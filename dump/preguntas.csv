1466,Why did the Pastor said every Deities like Buddha and hindu gods are all spirits and demon? Is Buddha statue consist of demon inside,Because he's ignorant!,"The pastor's statement, claiming deities like Buddha and Hindu gods are spirits and demons, likely stems from a particular theological interpretation within his faith, often a monotheistic one. This perspective may view any divine entity other than their own singular God as either a false spirit or a malevolent demon.\n\nThe belief that a Buddha statue ""consists of a demon inside"" is not a widely held view within Buddhism or Hinduism. Statues are typically seen as representations or focal points for devotion, not as containers for spirits or demons.

344,What sense does it make that factorial of zero is one? ,"It is supposed to make perfect sense. Number of ways to arrange 0 things is 1, since there are only one way, doing nothing.\nNot only that, this works nicely when you work with combination. There is also a generalization of factorial in real numbers, and you can also get 0!=1 from the new definition of factorial in real numbers.","The factorial of zero being one (0! = 1) is a convention that makes mathematical formulas work seamlessly. Consider the factorial function $n! = n \times (n-1)!$. If we set $n=1$, we get $1! = 1 \times 0!$. Since $1!$ is defined as 1, this forces $0!$ to be 1 to maintain the pattern.\n\nFurthermore, in combinatorics, $0!$ appears in formulas like the number of permutations of $n$ items ($n!$). The number of ways to arrange zero items is one (the empty arrangement). These reasons solidify $0! = 1$ as a logical and useful definition.",0.3416671398172823,1

In any 740 day period, any day a Guardsman/Reservist spends deployed (whether overseas or in the States) is called a ""high tempo day"".

If a deployment will take you over 400 ""high tempo days"" in the middle of the deployment, you greatly lessen your chances of being deployed.\n\nIt is still technically possible to be deployed with more than 400 high tempo days, but the general grade officers that be have to jump through so many hoops they have decided it is just easier to activate someone else who has the high tempo days available to rack up.\n\nIf you are a Reservist and you want to volunteer, just talk to your personnel sergeant.

3448,does hot water dry faster then cold water? ,"yes, it does.  \n\nhere's how evaporation works: the molecules of the water are bouncing around and colliding with each other, randomly changing direction and speed all the time.  when one molecule near the surface randomly gets a kick towards the surface (if it's moving fast enough to overcome the strength of hydrogen bonding) it will exit the condensed water and literally come shooting out of the liquid and into the air.  \n\nthe reverse process (condensation) happens at the same time - water molecules in the atmosphere will randomly go shooting into the surface of the liquid, where they are captured by water's hydrogen bonds.  if the air is humid enough, this will happen at the same rate as evaporation and the result will be called a dynamic equilibrium - water is evaporating and condensing in equal amounts and the water level will appear static.\n\nanyway, if you turn the temperature of the water up, the molecules move faster.  this is how we interpret the meaning of temperature on the microscopic level.  so, faster-moving molecules are more likely to overcome the hydrogen bonding, and therefore more often escape the water's surface, which results in faster evaporation.","Yes, hot water generally dries faster than cold water. This is due to a few factors:\n\n*   **Evaporation Rate:** Hot water molecules have more kinetic energy, meaning they move faster and are more likely to escape into the air as vapor.\n*   **Surface Tension:** Hot water has lower surface tension, allowing it to spread out more thinly over a surface, increasing the exposed area for evaporation.\n*   **Air Saturation:** Warmer air can hold more moisture, so as hot water evaporates, it can more readily mix with the surrounding air.",0.37798030206958944,1

4255,"guitar chord:  how does one do a ""Bsus2/B""? http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/tabs/n/new_pornographers/chump_change_crd.htm trying to figure out how to do the Bsus/B chord they refer to in this tab, also the Asus2/A, is there some way of combining tabs that I dont know about? thanks",First you must understand the notation that is being used to represent the chord.  The Bsus2 is the chord while the /B indicates the inversion that is being played (The note that is the lowest). Since the lowest note being played is the root then the chord is in its first inversion. That means that the /B part is redundant and not necessary. The author of the tab should not have notated the chord this way because it is confusing. Since the /B part is not necessary you should play a regular Bsus2 chord.\n\nFor more information visit (found via Google):\nhttp://www.all-guitar-chords.com/,"The ""/B"" or ""/A"" indicates a bass note. So, ""Bsus2/B"" means a Bsus2 chord with a B in the bass.\n\nFor Bsus2:\nE string: 2nd fret (B)\nA string: 2nd fret (E)\nD string: 4th fret (F#)\nG string: 4th fret (B)\nB string: 5th fret (C#)\ne string: 2nd fret (F#)\n\nThe ""/B"" simply means you're playing this chord over a bass note of B, which the lowest B on the E string already provides.\n\nFor Asus2/A, it's an Asus2 chord with an A in the bass.\n\nAsus2:\nE string: 5th fret (A)\nA string: 0th fret (A)\nD string: 2nd fret (E)\nG string: 2nd fret (B)\nB string: 0th fret (E)\ne string: 0th fret (A)\n\nAgain, the ""/A"" is fulfilled by the open A string. You're not combining tabs in a new way, just following the bass note indication.",0.25786733603753076,1

5987,Who is the Dajjal? ,"dajjal is an evil figure in Islamic eschatology, who will appear before Yaum al-Qiyamah (Day of the Resurrection). He is highly similar to the Antichrist in Christianity.\nVarious hadith, or traditions, are preserved about the attributes of ad-Dajjal like the following:\n\n1.He will be physically misshapen, and have one eye. There will be skin covering the area where the other eye is supposed to be .\n2.He will deceive the faithful, teaching them that Heaven is Hell and vice versa. \n3.He will have the power to work miracles in order to mislead believers. \n4.He will try to put Man on God's throne. \n5.He will have the Arabic letters kaf, fa and ra (kafir) -meaning unbeliever- branded on his forehead. \n6.He will have the ability to revive the dead, and consequently claim to be God. \n7.Some traditions of Islam relate that he will appear at Isfahan, and that he will rally the Isfahan Jews and many women to his support.\nThe Prophet Muhammad asked his followers to recite the first and last ten verses of Chapter 'The Cave' as protection from the Dajjal. These verses deal with the beliefs and activities of the Christian nations. He also taught his followers to pray, ""O Allah! I seek refuge in Thee from the trial of the Dajjal."" He also said, There is no tribulation greater than that of the Dajjal from the creation of Adam to the day of resurrection.\nThe occurrence of the Dajjal will correspond with the appearance of the Imam Mahdi, who will rally the faithful on earth to oppose him. Eventually, Isa (the name of Jesus in Arabic) will return from Heaven and slay the Dajjal. According to many interpretations this will occur near The Gate of Ludd (ancient city of Lydda) [1]. This will be followed by a Golden Age for Islam (not to be confused with the separate Islamic Golden Age) in which there are only true believers and almost everyone converts to Islam. Eventually decline will set in and by the will of Allah the End will come for Man. This is similar to a retelling of the Christian apocalypse where the end comes with the return of Jesus and Judgment Day.\nHe is mentioned in Chapter 16 of ""The Arabian Nights"": ""Sinbad Voyage 1"" or ""First Voyage""\n\n""Also to while away the time of waiting I explored a little island named Cassel, which belonged to King Mihrage, and which was supposed to be inhabited by a spirit named Deggial.

Also, lakes and the ocean can appear blueish, even when the sky is not a blue color to reflect.","The absorption minimum for water is at 420 nm, well within the blue range of the visual spectrum.

This color isn't due to light bending, but rather the water molecules themselves absorbing longer wavelengths of light (reds and yellows) more strongly than blues.\n\nWhen you have a large volume of water, like in a bathtub, lake, or ocean, this slight absorption becomes noticeable, giving it a visible bluish tint.

The diaphragm is the muscle that separates the chest and abdomen and helps with breathing. Hiccups can be triggered if you eat too much or too fast, consume very hot or cold foods and beverages, or drink carbonated beverages. Other causes include cold showers, entering or leaving a hot or cold room, sudden excitement, and stress. \nHiccups are not a serious medical condition and usually disappear on their own within a few minutes. If they last longer than 24 hours, hiccups may be a sign of another condition or injury. You should see your health care provider if you experience prolonged hiccuping. \n\nHome remedies are usually the primary treatment for hiccups, although no one is really sure how well they work. Hiccup home remedies include sneezing, being suddenly frightened, holding your breath, gargling, drinking pineapple juice, drinking water rapidly, sipping ice water, or swallowing dry granulated sugar. These activities may help by altering breathing patterns.","Hiccups are involuntary spasms of the diaphragm. While there's no guaranteed cure, many home remedies aim to interrupt the nerve signals causing them.

499,who wrote the book of revelation and in what year? ,"The question can best be answered by stating that John penned the book of Revelation, while our Lord Jesus is the Author.  The correct title of the book comes at the very beginning, ""The Revelation of Jesus Christ.""  John was shown what to write.  He received Revelation while imprisoned on the Isle of Patmos.\n\nThe strongest evidence for dating any ancient historical document is internal.  The second evidence is written tradition, a way of refering to non-scripture.  We know that unlike other apostles, John did not die a martyrs death.\n\nThe first history of the church, outside of the first century book of Acts (by Luke who also wrote Luke), was that of Eusebius in the 4th century.  Eusebius relates the story of John being carried to church in his old age, telling fellow Christians to love one another, for in that all was fulfilled.\n\nDates given for the writing vary, but scholars set a late date of being during the Roman Emperor Domitian's reign.  This is said to be about AD 95-96.  This is highly significant as it would be the very last ""theopneustos"" (God breathed) scripture written.\n\nIt is also significant, because the REVELATION OF JESUS CHRIST serves as the expounder and capstone of the prophetic writings.  It could be said that the most vital book to understanding Revelation is the book of Daniel, because this book is the only one which not only gives the events, but also the times (this is noted by Josephus in his description of Daniel).\n\nSince the author, our Lord Jesus, is eternal (Rev. 21:6), it could be said that His Revelation not only was written, but that it is and always has been written, and the book carries a great curse for whoever adds to it -- REVELATION ADDS ALL THE PLAGUES OF THE BOOK!!!  To those who take away -- IT SAYS GOD SHALL TAKE AWAY HIS PART OF THE BOOK OF LIFE, AND OUT OF THE HOLY CITY, AND FROM THE THINGS WHICH ARE WRITTEN IN THIS BOOK.\n\nYears ago, an old mentor of mine showed me a greek version of Revelation he had.  It showed the variants (places where somehow different manuscripts disagree).  Nevertheless, certain variants do not cast doubt upon the reliability of transmission.\n\nMy study of Revelation has revealed that a concordance, careful study, and reverence for Almighty God reveal the same exact themes found in varying scriptures, both old and new, (also helpful are the book of Enoch and also Yashir ""Jasher"").  Someone who is truly up to such a task shall find that only the Omniscient Creator could tie such a sweeping exposition of scripture into a dispersed narrative of the end of the age and the renewal of all things under Messiah.\n\nOur Lord Jesus Christ is the Author.  John wrote the book.\n\nI hope this helps.\n\nTake care,\nMark","The book of Revelation was written by **John the Apostle**.\n\nThe exact year of its writing is debated among scholars, but the most widely accepted timeframe is **around 95 AD**.

While the vast majority of American soldiers serve with honor, a small group engaged in brutal and illegal acts.

The soldiers involved were not representative of the U.S. military, and their actions were widely condemned as un-American and deeply damaging to the nation's reputation.",0,1

What is happening today about the stupid and offensive cartoons of Prophet Muhammad needs attention and comments -- not because of the stupid cartoons but because of what it has awakened hatred on both sides >>,"Education would go a long way on both sides to reduce tensions and explain differences. I don't think it's hatred as much as ignorance on the part of the West- ignorance breeds fear and resistance, not acceptance.","Yes, there is evidence of latent Islamophobia and anti-Arab sentiment in Europe and the West.

The heightened tensions demonstrate how perceived disrespect can ignite deeply held grievances and fuel mutual distrust, leading to an unfortunate escalation of hatred on both sides.

Any other choice of numerator and/or denominator will always result in a vacinity where the values are all around a single value. Mathematicians deal with this sort of uncertainty by saying that it is undefined.","The expression 0/0 is an indeterminate form, not a specific value like 1 or infinity.\n\nWhen you divide two numbers, say $a/b$, you're asking ""how many times does $b$ fit into $a$?"" If $a=0$, then $0/b = 0$ (for any non-zero $b$), meaning $b$ fits into 0 zero times.\n\nHowever, if $b=0$ as well, the question becomes ambiguous.\n* If we approach 0/0 from a limit where the numerator is approaching 0 faster than the denominator, the result can approach infinity.\n* If the denominator approaches 0 faster, the result can approach 0.\n* If they approach 0 at the same rate, the result can approach any finite number, including 1.\n\nBecause 0/0 can lead to any of these outcomes depending on the context, it's deemed ""indeterminate"" and doesn't have a single defined value.",0.3045120739038919,1

When i said ""includes both"", I meant including that he was the founder and about his life and such. I need it to be at least 600 words. (I have to have this for today, so if u are posting an answer after today, exclude this question. Plz and thankies.","Muawiya was not the founder of Sunni denomination of Islam. (See below)\n\nWith 940 million adherents, Sunni Islam is the largest denomination of Islam. Followers of the Sunni tradition are known as Sunnis or Sunnites; they sometimes refer to themselves as Ahlus Sunnah wal-Jamaa'h, ""adherents to the Sunnah and the assembly.""\n\nSunnis have their historical roots in the majority group who followed Abu Bakr, an effective leader, as Muhammad's successor, instead of his cousin and son-in-law Ali. The Sunnis are so named because they believe themselves to follow the sunnah or ""custom"" of the Prophet.\n\nAlgeria has nearly 99% Sunni Muslims (Sunni Islam is the state religion), Kuwait has 70% and Afghanistan has a majority of Sunni muslims (around 80%). Sunni Muslims also outnumber Shi'ite Muslims in Israel, Egypt, Turkey, Somalia, Uzbekistan, Sudan (70%), Syria (80%), Tajikistan (85%), Libya (97%), Jordan (92%) and certain islands like the Maldives, Comoros (98%) and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands (80%). Iraq has 45-60% of Sunni Muslims, who are concentrated mostly in the central & northern parts of the country. Sunni Muslims are a minority in Iran (10%) and Bahrain (30%).\n\nSunnis base their religion on the Quran and the Sunnah as understood by the majoroty of the community under the structure of the four schools of thought. The four Sunni schools of law (madhahib) - the Hanafi, the Maliki, the Shafi'i and the Hanbali - are sometimes mistakenly understood as different sects, but they are not. These four schools of religious law associate themselves with four great scholars of early Islam: Abu Haneefah, Malik, Shafi'i, and Ahmad bin Hanbal. These scholars were known for their knowledge and piety throughout the Muslim world. They differed only in minor issues of application of certain principles in the religion and were not in opposition to each other. In fact, Ahmad bin Hanbal was a student of Shafi'i, who was a student of Malik.\n\nSufism is considered by the majority of Sunnis to be integral part of Sunni Islam. It deals with the spiritual aspects of a Sunni Muslim's everyday life. Some of the most famous Sufi schools are the Qadiri, Naqshbandi, Shadhili, Chishti, and Rifa‘i paths or tariqas.\n\nSunnis view the Shi'ites as from the ahlul-bidah; i.e., the people of innovation. Sunnis oppose Shi'ite beliefs concerning some of the companions of the Prophet, the belief in the Imamate and difference on the Caliphate, and others. Other groups considered to be outside Islam by Sunnis are Nation of Islam, Ahmadiyya, and Ismailis.\n\nShia Islam includes most of the Muslims that are not counted among the Sunni. The primary division within Islam, between Sunni and Shi'a, dates to the death of the Prophet Muhammad when his followers were faced with the decision of who would be his successor as the leader of Islam. Shi'ites are those who followed Ali, the closest relative of Muhammad, as Muhammad's successor. Today there are approximately 120 million Shi'ite Muslims in the world.\n\nThe Shia consist of one major school of thought known as the Jafaryia or the ""Twelvers,"" and a few minor schools of thought, as the ""Seveners"" or the ""Fivers."" These names all refer to the number of imams they recognize after the death of Muhammad. The term Shi'a is usually meant to be synonymous with the Jafaryia/Twelvers.\n\nThe Origins of the Sunni/Shia split in Islam\nAli is the central figure at the origin of the Shia / Sunni split which occurred in the decades immediately following the death of the Prophet in 632. Sunnis regard Ali as the fourth and last of the ""rightly guided caliphs"" (successors to Mohammed (pbuh) as leader of the Muslims) following on from Abu Bakr 632-634, Umar 634-644 and Uthman 644-656. Shias feel that Ali should have been the first caliph and that the caliphate should pass down only to direct descendants of Mohammed (pbuh","Muawiya I was a pivotal figure in early Islamic history, but he is not considered the *founder* of the Sunni branch of Islam. The Sunni and Shia branches of Islam diverged after the Prophet Muhammad's death over a dispute regarding his succession. Muawiya was a prominent figure in the Umayyad Caliphate and played a significant role in shaping Islamic political and religious thought. While it's inaccurate to label him as the founder of Sunni Islam, many historical biographies discuss his life and the events that contributed to the early divisions within the Muslim community. For a biography that covers Muawiya's life and the context of the early Islamic divisions, you could explore works by reputable historians such as: * **""The History of the Arabs"" by Philip K. Hitti:** This classic provides a comprehensive overview of Arab history, including detailed accounts of the early caliphates and the Umayyad era. * **""A",0.72841996162163,1

1559,What are some good tips for studying for finals? I am going to be dead once finals are over. How can I study without being os stressed out?,"Ok you need to study in small sessions, and anything most important right before you go to bed. Study for 20-30 minutes, take a 10 minutes break, 20-30 minutes, 10 minute break. Studies show this helps the brain most. Also, study actively. For example, don't just read over something, make a game out of it, or have someone quiz you on it.  Always get 8 hours of sleep, eat healthy foods and plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables, and make sure you start studying at least 1.5-2 weeks before your exams. Make little notecards so you can quiz yourself in those odd moments like on the bus or in line at the store or where ever. If you also re-write key concepts, that helps your brain remember them better. Even if you have a scantron test, know the concept well enough to write an essay so that you are more prepared than you need to be.","To study for finals without excessive stress, start early and create a realistic schedule. Break down material into manageable chunks and focus on understanding, not just memorizing. Utilize active recall techniques like flashcards or practice questions. Take regular breaks to rest your brain and body. Prioritize sleep, nutrition, and light exercise to maintain energy and focus. Remember, a well-prepared mind is a less stressed mind.

In a shock wave the properties of the fluid(density, pressure, temperature, velocity, Mach number) change almost instantaneously. Measurements of the thickness of shock waves have resulted in values approximately one order of magnitude greater than the mean free path of the gas investigated.\n\nShock waves are not sound waves; a shock wave takes the form of a very sharp change in the gas properties on the order of micro-meters in thickness. Shock waves in air are heard as a loud ""crack"" or ""snap"" noise. Over time a shock wave can change from a nonlinear wave into a linear wave, degenerating into a conventional sound wave as it heats the air and loses energy.

Interesting, huh?","A shock wave is a powerful, abrupt pressure disturbance traveling faster than the speed of sound. Imagine a rapid explosion. It instantly pushes air outward with immense force.

5711,why is the normal rate of breathing of the people is decreasing when growing old? ,Respiratory rate is in part controlled by the person's overall metabolic rate.  All of the body metabolic processes impact each other.  Breathing can and does change if you body becomes acidic or basic.\n\nBoth breathing and metabolism slow with age as the body goes through normal changes. This is the same reason that a 20 year old can eat 3500 Calories of food and not gain weight.  The same person at age 45 would likely have a slower metabolism and if they could eat that much would likely gain a lot of weight.,"As we age, lung capacity and elasticity naturally decrease. The muscles involved in breathing also become weaker. This reduces the efficiency of gas exchange, meaning older adults may breathe less frequently to conserve energy. While resting respiratory rate may slow, the body compensates by taking deeper breaths when needed.",0.24246623139896573,2

No college wants to admit a delinquent.  Play a sport if you can, participate in clubs or other activities.  If nothing else, volunteer. \n\nAs for choosing a college, you definitely need to start thinking about this already if you are 16.

Ex: same as above\n\nAfter this, do some research.  There are websites to help you, or you can go to the library or Barnes & Noble and look at the 2006 colleges and universities book.  \n\nAfter you pick out schools, make sure you have at least the following: \n\n1 safety school\n1 favorite that you'll probably attend\n1 favorite that is kind of a stretch\n1 bigger stretch\n\nIf you're less of a risk-taker or can't afford that many, just have a favorite and a back-up safety school. \n\nKnow the SAT/ACT range needed for your schools of choice and retake the tests if necessary to hit close to the range. \n\nApply early!  Some colleges have ""early decision"" programs, where if you are accepted the fall of your senior year of HS.  Some colleges have rolling admissions, some make all of their decisions at one time. \n\nIf you need financial help, apply for government loans and research scholarships that are specific to your school.\n\nMost of all, just relax and stay organized.  College is a great time of your life!","Start exploring interests early! Take challenging classes and join clubs that align with your passions. Visit colleges virtually or in person to get a feel for different environments. Don't stress too much about early decisions; focus on finding a good fit.\n\nIn college, be open to new experiences.

And, treat their dirty book with ""respect""?  How is that all right?\n\nI just need to understand.","Women and children are to be treated with the utmost respect according to the Koran (which is not a dirty book). The extremists misinterpret Mohammad's writings to meet their personal needs, just like Christian extremists misinterpret the Bible to meet their personal needs (regarding homosexuality for example). \n\nThe prisoners you're referring to have not yet been convicted of anything, and many have been released over the last 3 years because there was no evidence to hold them, which means there must be more that are being held without evidence as well. Until they're convicted of terrorism, they should be treated as we would want to be treated in that situation (think of the Americans that are kidnapped in Iraq -- we want them treated with respect).\n\nI don't understand why the Afghan government thinks it's ok to execute a man for converting to Christianity. That is not Mohammad's teachings. See the democratically elected government we helped put into place? Pretty similar to the Taliban, isn't it? God help them all.","The premise of your question contains significant misunderstandings of Islamic law.\n\nIslam unequivocally condemns the killing of innocent children. Such acts are considered grave sins. Similarly, there is no basis in Islamic law for killing someone who converts from Islam. Apostasy is a complex issue within Islamic jurisprudence, but the prevailing scholarly view does not mandate capital punishment for it.\n\nRegarding prisoners of war, Islamic teachings emphasize humane treatment, including providing sustenance. The Quran is considered a sacred text by Muslims, and offering it to prisoners is an act of respect for their religious beliefs, not an endorsement of all its content or practices.

2992,what is  the origin of life? ,"Research into the origin of life is a limited field of research despite its profound impact on biology and human understanding of the natural world. Progress in this field is generally slow and sporadic, though it still draws the attention of many due to the gravity of the question being investigated. A few facts give insight into the conditions in which life may have emerged, but the mechanisms by which non-life became life are still elusive.\n\nFor the observed evolution of life on earth, see the timeline of life.\n\nResearch into the origin of life is the modern incarnation of the ancient concept of abiogenesis. Abiogenesis, in its most general sense, is the generation of life from non-living matter. The term is primarily used in the context of biology and the origin of life. Abiogenesis was long considered to be a very common occurrence until the Law of Biogenesis (omne vivum ex ovo or ""all life from an egg"") became firmly established in modern biology as a result of the work of Louis Pasteur.\n\nCharles Darwin in a letter to J.D. Hooker of February 1st 1871, made the suggestion that life may have begun in a ""warm little pond, with all sorts of ammonia and phosphoric salts, lights, heat, electricity, etc. present, that a protein compound was chemically formed ready to undergo still more complex changes, at the present day such matter would be instantly devoured or absorbed, which would not have been the case before living creatures were formed."" Thus, it is the presence of life itself, operating in an oxygen rich atmosphere, itself a product of life, which prevents ""spontaneous generation"" from occurring on Earth today.\n\nThis modern definition of abiogenesis is concerned with the formation of the simplest forms of life from primordial chemicals, in an environment regarded as similar to that at the time shortly after the formation of the Earth. This is significantly different from the concept of Aristotelian abiogenesis, which postulated the formation of complex organisms. This article reviews different hypotheses for modern abiogenetic processes that are currently under debate.\n\nThere is no truly ""standard"" model of the origin of life, however most currently accepted models build in one way or another upon a number of discoveries concerning the origin of molecular and cellular components for life, which are listed in a rough order of postulated emergence:\n\nPlausible pre-biotic conditions result in the creation of certain basic small molecules (monomers) of life, such as amino acids. This was demonstrated in the Urey-Miller experiment by Stanley L. Miller and Harold C. Urey in 1953. \nPhospholipids (of an appropriate length) can spontaneously form lipid bilayers, one of the two basic components of a cell membrane. \nThe polymerization of nucleotides into random RNA molecules might have resulted in self-replicating ribozymes (RNA world hypothesis). \nSelection pressures for catalytic efficiency and diversity result in ribozymes which catalyse peptidyl transfer (hence formation of small proteins), since oligopeptides complex with RNA to form better catalysts. Thus the first ribosome is born, and protein synthesis becomes more prevalent. \nProteins outcompete ribozymes in catalytic ability, and therefore become the dominant biopolymer. Nucleic acids are restricted to predominantly genomic use. \nThe origin (see Origin of organic molecules) of the basic biomolecules, while not settled, is less controversial than the significance and order of steps 2 and 3. The basic inorganic chemicals from which life was formed are methane (CH4), ammonia (NH3), water (H2O), hydrogen sulfide (H2S), carbon dioxide (CO2), and phosphate (PO43-). As of 2004, no one has yet synthesized a ""protocell"" using basic components which has the necessary properties of life (the so-called ""bottom-up-approach""). Without such a proof-of-principle, explanations have tended to be short on specifics","The origin of life is the hypothetical process by which living organisms arose from non-living matter, such as simple organic compounds. Scientific theories suggest it likely occurred through a series of chemical reactions on early Earth. These reactions, potentially energized by lightning or volcanic activity, led to the formation of more complex molecules like amino acids and nucleotides. These then assembled into self-replicating structures, eventually evolving into the first cells. While the exact sequence is still debated, abiogenesis remains the leading scientific explanation for life's beginning.",0.5089889592684436,1

5303,"Does anyone else think that going to war for oil is actually worth it in the long run? What I mean is, without oil, factories couldn't run, all forms of transportation would grind to a halt, and almost nobody would even be able to heat their homes in the winter. The entire economy and all quality of life would go down the toilet, and would drag the entire world economy down with it. So isn't going to war to secure a steady supply of oil actually worth the cost?","Difficult question you post that could cause many to drop down a ""knee jerk"" answer.  First of course everyone will say that human life is of more value than any natural resource.  But think of all the people who'd die of cold in the winter without oil.  And the economics of high priced oil can leave millions out of work and in some really dire circumstances.  However it's the ""in the long run"" portion of your question that makes me say that war for oil is not worth it.  The correct thing to do, and I believe this with every fiber in my being, is to find ways around the problem of oil.  Capitalism is suppose to be the perfect system where if a resource is not quite as abundant as one would hope, and therefore more expensive, then the market will find a way around it.  New energies, conservation, etc.  The fact that the powerful in business and politics right now don't want to ""waste"" their money researching these things and would rather ride on others backs to fight for cheaper oil is idiotic.  \nOn the bright side, the President mentioned this exact idea in his State of the Union Address.  Whether it was simple lip service or not remains to be seen.","While the economic and societal reliance on oil is undeniable, framing war as a justifiable long-term solution for securing its supply is a complex and debated issue. Proponents might argue that the immediate disruption and collapse of modern life, as you describe, could be prevented by ensuring oil access. However, this perspective often overlooks the immense human cost of war, including loss of life, displacement, and long-term geopolitical instability. Furthermore, the environmental consequences of both oil extraction and warfare add significant further costs. The pursuit of alternative energy sources is increasingly seen by many as a more sustainable and ultimately less costly long-term strategy for global stability and well-being, even if the transition presents its own challenges.",0.43961585869313713,1

6405,what came first..the chicken or the egg? who decided what was a curse word?,"In nature, living things evolve through changes in their DNA. In an animal like a chicken, DNA from a male sperm cell and a female ovum meet and combine to form a zygote -- the first cell of a new baby chicken. This first cell divides innumerable times to form all of the cells of the complete animal. In any animal, every cell contains exactly the same DNA, and that DNA comes from the zygote. \n\nChickens evolved from non-chickens through small changes caused by the mixing of male and female DNA or by mutations to the DNA that produced the zygote. These changes and mutations only have an effect at the point where a new zygote is created. That is, two non-chickens mated and the DNA in their new zygote contained the mutation(s) that produced the first true chicken. That one zygote cell divided to produce the first true chicken. \n\nPrior to that first true chicken zygote, there were only non-chickens. The zygote cell is the only place where DNA mutations could produce a new animal, and the zygote cell is housed in the chicken's egg. So, the egg must have come first.","The chicken-and-egg paradox has no definitive answer; it's a philosophical riddle.\n\nThe concept of ""curse words"" evolved organically within societies.

Others, like many Muslims, believe depicting prophets can lead to idolatry, emphasizing a direct connection to God.\n\nRegarding the portrayal of Jesus, the debate over casting reflects broader societal conversations about representation and inclusivity. Ultimately, the core of religious practice often lies in prayer and spiritual connection, rather than the visual aids themselves.

4,Why do women get PMS? ,"Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a group of symptoms related to the menstrual cycle. PMS is linked to changes in the endocrine system, which produces hormones that control the menstrual cycle. Medical experts don't fully understand the chain of events that causes premenstrual symptoms to be severe in some women and not in others. The one direct cause that is known to affect some women is genetic: Many women with PMS have a close family member with a history of PMS.","Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS) occurs due to hormonal fluctuations in a woman's body during the menstrual cycle. As estrogen and progesterone levels change after ovulation and before menstruation, they can affect neurotransmitters like serotonin, which regulate mood and emotions. These shifts, combined with individual sensitivities to hormones, can lead to a range of physical and emotional symptoms. Nutritional factors, stress, and genetics also play a role in how intensely a woman experiences PMS.",0.2817102569758928,8

4699,What hepatitis c? ,"Heptitis C is a disease of the liver, The hepatitis C virus (HCV) is one of the most important causes of chronic liver disease in the United States. It accounts for about 20 percent of acute viral hepatitis, 60 to 70 percent of chronic hepatitis, and 30 percent of cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease, and liver cancer. Almost 4 million Americans, or 1.8 percent of the U.S. population, have antibody to HCV (anti-HCV), indicating ongoing or previous infection with the virus. Hepatitis C causes an estimated 8,000 to 10,000 deaths annually in the United States.\n\nA distinct and major characteristic of hepatitis C is its tendency to cause chronic liver disease. At least 75 percent of patients with acute hepatitis C ultimately develop chronic infection, and most of these patients have accompanying chronic liver disease.\n\nChronic hepatitis C varies greatly in its course and outcome. At one end of the spectrum are patients who have no signs or symptoms of liver disease and completely normal levels of serum liver enzymes. Liver biopsy usually shows some degree of chronic hepatitis, but the degree of injury is usually mild, and the overall prognosis may be good. At the other end of the spectrum are patients with severe hepatitis C who have symptoms, HCV RNA in serum, and elevated serum liver enzymes, and who ultimately develop cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease. In the middle of the spectrum are many patients who have few or no symptoms, mild to moderate elevations in liver enzymes, and an uncertain prognosis. Researchers estimate that at least 20 percent of patients with chronic hepatitis C develop cirrhosis, a process that takes 10 to 20 years. After 20 to 40 years, a smaller percentage of patients with chronic disease develop liver cancer.\n\nChronic hepatitis C can cause cirrhosis, liver failure, and liver cancer. About 20 percent of patients develop cirrhosis within 10 to 20 years of the onset of infection. Liver failure from chronic hepatitis C is one of the most common reasons for liver transplants in the United States. Hepatitis C might be the most common cause of primary liver cancer in the developed world. In Italy, Spain, and Japan, at least half of liver cancers could be related to HCV. Men, alcoholics, patients with cirrhosis, people over age 40, and those infected for 20 to 40 years are more likely to develop HCV-related liver cancer.\n\nRisk Factors and Transmission\n\nHCV is spread primarily by contact with blood and blood products. Blood transfusions and the use of shared, unsterilized, or poorly sterilized needles and syringes have been the main causes of the spread of HCV in the United States. With the introduction in 1991 of routine blood screening for HCV antibody and improvements in the test in mid-1992, transfusion-related hepatitis C has virtually disappeared. At present, injection drug use is the most common risk factor for contracting the disease. However, many patients acquire hepatitis C without any known exposure to blood or to drug use.\n\nThe major high-risk groups for hepatitis C are:\n\nPeople who had blood transfusions before June 1992, when sensitive tests for anti-HCV were introduced for blood screening. \nPeople who have frequent exposure to blood products. These include patients with hemophilia, solid-organ transplants, chronic renal failure, or cancer requiring chemotherapy. \nHealth care workers who suffer needle-stick accidents \nInjection drug users, including those who used drugs briefly many years ago \nInfants born to HCV-infected mothers \nOther groups who appear to be at slightly increased risk for hepatitis C are:\n\nPeople with high-risk sexual behavior, multiple partners, and sexually transmitted diseases \nPeople who use cocaine, particularly with intranasal administration, using shared equipment \nMaternal-Infant Transmission\n\nMaternal-infant transmission is not common. In most studies, only 5 percent of infants born to infected women become infected. The disease in newborns is u","Hepatitis C is a viral infection that primarily affects the liver. It's caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV) and is usually spread through contact with infected blood, often via sharing needles or other drug injection equipment.\n\nMany people with Hepatitis C have no symptoms, but some may experience fatigue, nausea, loss of appetite, and abdominal pain.

7827,how is a capacitor manufactured? ,"You need to plates and a dielectric.  The dielectric can be air, and a lot of variable capacitors use air and change the capacitance by moving the plates and thus changing the amount of area overlapped by the plates.\n\nIf you want to be able to store a lot of energy, you need to use different dielctrics and materials for the plates.  To increase the capacitance, you have to either increase the surface area of the plates or use a dielectric material with a high dielectric constant.  \n\nIn aluminum capacitors, the plates are made of aluminum and the surface area is increased by using solutions that cause tunnels to form inside aluminum foil. This can increase the surface area over 100 times.  The dielectric is formed by growing an oxide layer on top of the aluminum which is very thin (microns).  \n\nIn tantalum capacitor, one of the plates called the anode is formed from tantalum by taking tantalum powder, pressing it into a pellet, and sintering (or partially fusing) the tantalum particles together in a furnace.  This makes a solid pellet with a lot of pores, and so it has a very high suface area. A tantalum wire is either pressed with the pellet or welded later to form one of the terminations in the finished capacitor. Tantalum oxide can then be grown on to of the tantalum to form the dielectric.  The other plate, called the cathode, is formed by dipping this pellet into manganese dioxide solutions.  The manganese dioxide is able to penetrate the pores and cover much of the surface area on top of the dielectric.  It is then dipped into a carbon paint solution and cured, and the carbon layer efficiently contacts the manganese dioxide layer and protects the sensitive dielectic layer from the next layer, the silver layer which is also normally applied by dipping the pellet into a paint and curing.  The robustness of the silver layer and its excellent conductivity is needed beacause a second termination is attached to it.  This assembly is covered with epoxy to protect it from mechanical stresses, but the terminations remain partially exposed to allow for attaching to a circuit board.","Capacitors are manufactured by layering conductive and insulating materials. Typically, two metal plates (electrodes) are separated by a dielectric material (insulator), such as ceramic, plastic film, or an electrolyte. This layered structure is then rolled or folded into a compact form. Wires or tabs are attached to the electrodes for connection. Various designs and materials are used depending on the capacitor's intended application, voltage rating, and capacitance value.",0.3124859449112125,1

They charge incredibly ridiculous rates of interest, and if you're not careful, you can wind up in a vicious cycle with them.  Here's how:  you borrow $100 till next payday.  Then your paycheck arrives, but you don't have an extra $100 to pay back the loan.  They offer to roll it over for you.  Then you decide to take out another $50 just to get you by till next payday.  Now you owe $150 plus a whole ton of interest.  Oh yeah, and fees too.  \n\nSo what's a person to do if you're tight on cash?  Talk to your credit union or bank.  See about alternatives they have to payday loans.  Even opening a credit card will charge you less interest than using a payday lender.  \n\nThen, take a good hard look in the mirror and figure out how to cut expenses so you aren't strapped for cash.  Perhaps you could get a 2nd job for awhile to bring in some additional money.","Many ""fast payday loan"" sites are legitimate, but it's crucial to be cautious. They do offer quick access to funds, but at a very high cost due to exorbitant interest rates and fees. This can trap borrowers in a cycle of debt.\n\nSome sites may indeed be scams, primarily focused on collecting your personal and financial information for fraudulent purposes. Always research a lender thoroughly, check for state licensing, and read reviews before applying. Be wary of any site that guarantees approval or pressures you to act immediately.",0.3164174130977054,1

407,What are the benefits of switching from win 2000 pro to XP? I want to use my PC more for multimedia.,"Hello, \n\nHere are some strong reason's you should consider upgrading to XP. \n\nStability. Windows XP has the ability to run a large number of apps without running out of resources, without crashing. (If you're running Windows 2000, you already have this, so there's no gain. \nSecurity. This is a huge topic that I can't adequately cover in a few sentences suffice to say that security of your data and your privacy in Windows XP is leaps and bounds beyond anything available in Windows 9x. (Again, if you have Windows 2000, you already have most of the security capabilities of Windows XP.) \nUI enhancements. A variety of changes in Start menu, taskbar, Windows Explorer, and Control Panel make everyday tasks such as launching programs, switching between windows, and managing files just a little bit faster, easier, and more convenient. These features can each be customized, so you can use the ones you like and change others back to Windows 9x/2000 style. (Similarly, you can banish the new look of Windows XP while still enjoying its other benefits.) \nFast User Switching. Great for shared computers, FUS lets someone else log on without requiring you to first close all your documents and applications. \nPower management. Standby and hibernation let me save power (on desktop PCs as well as portables) yet still have fast boot time, bringing me right back to where I left off. (That is, all the windows that I left open when the system powers down are already open when I power up.) \nDigital photo support. I was never a fan of digital photography until I got XP because it was such a hassle before. But the support for cameras and scanners, as well as the features built in to Windows Explorer for viewing, printing, e-mailing, and manipulating images have actually made it fun and practical to work with photos in new ways. \nRemote Assistance. The ability to actually see and work with someone else's screen while conversing with them through text, voice, and video chat is a killer feature for anyone who's looked upon as a computer guru and gets calls for support from relatives, friends, and neighbors. (I suspect that includes most PIBMUG members!) \nRemote Desktop. The ability to connect with my home computer from the office (or vice versa) is awesome. It looks and acts exactly as if I'm at that computer five miles away, and I have access to all its files, printers, and other resources. And like remote assistance, it's acceptably fast if you have broadband Internet access. I also use it to work with other computers on my own LAN that's sometimes easier than hopping back and forth between two computers. \nBetter help. It's easier to navigate, integrates information from the Microsoft Knowledge Base, and includes links to a number of diagnostic tools. \n\nPlease see here for more http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=why+upgrade+from+windows+2000+to+XP&prssweb=Search&ei=UTF-8&fr=FP-tab-web-t&fl=0&x=wrt \n\nhttp://www.windowsusers.org/whyupgrade.html","Switching from Windows 2000 Pro to XP for multimedia offers significant advantages. XP boasts improved driver support for a wider range of audio and video hardware, ensuring better compatibility and performance with your multimedia devices.\n\nYou'll experience enhanced multimedia playback with improved codecs and DirectX versions, leading to smoother video and audio.

They believe that denying these rights can lead to greater societal problems.\n\nOthers contend that legal rights should be reserved for citizens or those who have legally entered a country.

While antibiotics can have side effects and contribute to antibiotic resistance if misused, their benefits in treating serious illnesses like pneumonia or sepsis often outweigh the risks.

9471,how were the egyptian pyramids built? ,"The Egyptian pyramids were built using an enormous labour force - ordinary citizens served for a few months of each year to work as well as full time craftsmen who worked to build the monuments.  Typically, a king began construction of his pyramid complex soon after ascending the throne and construction continued until his death.\nThe earliest pyramids were solid stone structures.  After a sight was selected and prepared, the foundation was laid with large blocks being dragged in on sledges - a sort of sled-like vehicle.  As the pyramid rose, a ramp was used to move blocks into place higher up the structure.  Frequently, local stone was used for the interior blocks of the pyramid and finer stone was brought from special sources for the exterior casing of the pyramid.\nIn later pyramids, the core was frequently not of solid stone but of rubble or mudbrick with an outer facing of nicer stone.  Eventually pyramids were constructed primarily of mudbrick rather than stone.","The construction of Egyptian pyramids remains a marvel, with prevailing theories suggesting a combination of immense human labor and ingenious engineering.\n\nVast numbers of skilled laborers, farmers during the Nile flood season, and possibly enslaved people, quarried and transported enormous stone blocks. These were likely moved using ramps, sledges, and levers. Precision in measurement and alignment was achieved through sophisticated surveying techniques. While the exact methods are debated, the scale of the undertaking and the meticulous planning are undeniable.",0.427209433265896,1

I tried to type a question in all caps and the page refreshed said do not use all caps i's rude,"Typing in all caps is the online equivalent to yelling, and therefore bad manners. All caps are also harder to read. Here's why...\n\nOnce we have mastered reading (not sounding out words letter by letter), we recognize words by their shape rather than by the order of the letters. Think about it...you read whole words, not individual letters. When words are typed in all caps, they lose their shape -- that is, they become rectangular. The reader has to revert to reading them one letter at a time, hence slowing them down.\n\nGraphics designers use this as a tool to draw attention by slowing down a reader. It is an effective tool when used properly.","Typing in all caps is considered rude because it mimics shouting. In digital communication, it lacks the nuance of vocal tone and can come across as aggressive, demanding, or confrontational. It's difficult to read for extended periods and can feel overwhelming. Most platforms discourage it for readability and to maintain a polite online environment.

If she likes stuffed animals you can give her little stuffed animals after you've had a couple of dates. It's really not hard. Don't buy her really expensive things untill you get very serious. Be polite and respectful and complement her on the things she wears and even her perfume if she wears any. After you get serious you can send flowers to her work or her school. Girls like public displays of affection. I hope that helps hun, and if it doesn't than there are plenty of other girls that will love it!","It's great that you're looking to express yourself authentically! Your voice doesn't define your identity. Many factors contribute to how someone sounds, and it's not a determinant of sexual orientation.

7253,"Brown Light Spotting since period ended for about 5 days now.? I have always been regular and never ever had any spotting once my period ended. This past period I began birth control pills but stopped after 1 week due to side effects. After my period ended I have been spotting, it is now 5 days. Its light, no scent, and brownish. This is really worrying me and I am going to call my GYN come monday but I would like any advice. Also my fiance and I have unprotected sex, he pulls out, for almost 2 yrs now and we both have gotten tested for all std's and both of us came back clean, and my pap came back within the normal range and we are exclusive and have not cheated on each other. Any suggestions or help will be greatful especially since I probably won't be able to get a GYN appt. for 2 weeks or more that is always the case.  Thank You","This is kind of funny but I answered the same question for my female friend less then two days ago because she had the same issue, same problem! I researched it for her as a medic that likes to study gyn and here's your answer: The surge of hormones in your body causes your endometrium (lining of the uterus) to become extremely thick and then fissure and crack (so to speak) at your fourth week and then to fold and flush out of your body(menses). When you take the pill it enforces a state of pregnancy on the body and causes your endometrium to thicken and stay thickened so that you cannot become pregnant because your body already thinks that it is. So when your on it for three days or more esp. right after your period your endometrium starts to thicken again rapidly due to the surge of hormones the pill is providing, but then you suddenly come off and your body is like what the hec!?! I need to flush my lining again but it's not thick enough for a complete mense so it just releases the little that it's built up by infrequent spotting till the lining goes back to ex nhilo, or the beginning of a fresh cycle. So it's really nothing to worry about at all unless you starting cramping terribly and have spotting into the two week range. Then you should see your gyno. I hope I covered everything if I missed something post an additional detail and I'll do my best to answer it.","It's understandable to be concerned about spotting after your period, especially when it's unusual for you. Since you recently started and stopped birth control pills, this spotting could be a hormonal fluctuation or a side effect of the pills. Other possibilities, though less likely given your history and testing, include ovulation spotting or, very rarely, early pregnancy-related bleeding.\n\nGiven your history of regular periods and the new spotting, it's wise to contact your GYN. They can provide the most accurate diagnosis and advice after discussing your specific situation and potentially scheduling an examination.",0.44460792831777324,1

Whenever i go work out, or sweat in the sun for some reason, why is that i feel sleepy/drowsy? Is there any medical or logical reason for this. Sources would be appreaciated.","People naturally sleep better in a cold room or when the body becomes suddenly cold. This is due to part of your circadian rhythm. In addition to sleep naturally being effected by light (your internal clock, the superchiasmatic nucleus, is located near the optic chiasm where the optic nerves cross); most humans will wake easier by the light of the sun and sleep easier in the dark, there is also sleep regulation based on body temperature. \n\nThe human core body temperature changes slightly throughout a day. At around 3 AM the body temperature is at its lowest. It starts to rise until near noon when it plateus and even dips a little bit (this results in people getting tired around lunch time...not because of the lunch itself, after all, you don't get tired after eating breakfast or dinner). Many populations, such as Mexico, take into account this normal fatigue and allow workers to nap (siesta) around that time. Afternoon the body starts rising in temperature again until around 8 PM when it begins to fall again overnight.","Feeling sleepy after exercising and entering an air-conditioned space is a common physiological response. When you exercise, your body heats up. Sweating is your body's way of cooling down by evaporating moisture. Entering a cool, air-conditioned environment enhances this cooling process. Your blood vessels, which had dilated (widened) during exercise to release heat, begin to constrict in the cooler air. This can lead to a slight drop in blood pressure and a feeling of lethargy or sleepiness. Additionally, the contrast between your warm, sweaty body and the cool air can trigger a parasympathetic nervous system response, which is associated with rest and digestion, further promoting a relaxed and sleepy state. There isn't a specific medical condition associated with this phenomenon; it's a normal, temporary adjustment your body makes. **Source:** * ""Physiology of Exercise"" - While not a single web link, this is a broad area of study.

However, its not always many males with females...that depends on the species. Sometimes its just one male and one female.  The male inserts his hemipene into the anal opening of the female and finding the vagina, releases sperm.","Snakes reproduce sexually, with males possessing a pair of hemipenes (penis-like organs) for internal fertilization.\n\nMating rituals vary: some males engage in combat to win over females, while others use scent trails or courtship displays. Once receptive, the female allows the male to insert a hemipenis into her cloaca (a single opening for waste and reproduction). Fertilization occurs internally, and the female then lays eggs or gives birth to live young, depending on the species.",0.31744021630613445,1

2627,How does antibiotics affect birth control? ,"Health care providers, clinicians, and researchers have been debating the potential of antibiotics hindering the effectiveness of oral contraceptives for quite some time. There have been several research studies that concluded that some antibiotics do indeed decrease the effectiveness of the pill. Hence, it becomes more likely that an unintended pregnancy could occur. \nThe general recommendation when taking antibiotics for a short amount of time is to use an additional backup contraceptive method such as a latex condom during the treatment time and for one week afterward. When taking antibiotics for a long period of time, the general recommendation is to use an additional backup method for the first two weeks of the antibiotic use. \nIt also is important to remember that you should continue using the pill unless directed otherwise by your health care provider. He/she may provide more specific instructions based on your individual situation, medication, or health status.","Certain antibiotics can reduce the effectiveness of hormonal birth control methods like pills, patches, and rings. This happens because the antibiotics can interfere with how your body absorbs or processes the hormones, making them less potent.\n\nAs a result, if you're on hormonal birth control and taking certain antibiotics, you may be at a higher risk of unintended pregnancy. It's crucial to use a backup method of contraception, such as condoms, while taking these antibiotics and for a period afterward, as advised by your doctor or pharmacist.

The resulting change in the transmembrane potential of the muscle fiber leads to the production of action petential that spreads across the entire surface of the muscle fiber and along the T tubules.\n\n3.The sarcoplasmic reticulum releases stored calcium ions, increasing the calcium concentration of the sarcoplasm in and around the sarcomeres.\n\n4. Calcium ions bind to triponin, producing a change in the orientation of the troponin-tropomyosin complex that exposes active sites on the thin filaments (actin). Cross-bridges form when myosin heads bind to the active sites on F actin.\n\n5.

Actin forms thin filaments, while myosin forms thick filaments.\n\n**Ca+2 (Calcium ions)** act as a trigger. When muscle cells are stimulated, Ca+2 is released, binding to troponin on actin. This binding causes a conformational change, exposing the myosin-binding sites on actin.\n\n**ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate)** provides the energy for muscle contraction.

5215,How is the freezing point specifically determined from a cooling curve? ,"The freezing point of a pure substance can be derived from a cooling curve plotting the temperature versus time.\n\nAs energy is taken out of a liquid, its temperature falls.  When the temperature reaches the freezing point of the substance, energy is taken out, but the temperature remains constant.  At this point, the cooling curve levels out this is quite evident when looking at the graph.\n\nThis leveling off effect is seen because in order for the substance to free, additional energy must be removed from the liquid, this is called the latent heat of fusion.  After the substance is frozen, the temperature of the solid can continue to drop.\n{this same effect can also be seen as something melt, boils, condenses, or sublimes}","A cooling curve plots temperature against time as a substance cools. The freezing point is identified by a **horizontal plateau** on the curve. This plateau indicates that the temperature remains constant despite the continuous removal of heat. During freezing, the energy released by the phase change (liquid to solid) counteracts the heat being lost to the surroundings, maintaining a steady temperature until all the liquid has solidified. The temperature at which this plateau occurs is the freezing point.",0.6431569824132174,2

7311,why cant an airplane go in space like a rocket? ,"As thhe ""air"" in airplane implies, airplanes need air to fly.  Their engines are designed to take in air, mix it with fuel and combust it to produce energy for propellers or jet engine thrust.  Although many jetliners can operate at very high altitudes in thin air they can not operate within the near perfect vacuum of space with no air (oxygen) at all.  Also, airplanes are propelled through air using wings (air foils) that give the airplane lift and control.

They can not ""fly"" in air although some can glide to return to earth.","Airplanes need air to fly.

By this physical work the material gets heated.","Infrared heat is created by the **vibration of atoms and molecules**.\n\nWhen matter absorbs energy (from electricity, friction, or other sources), its constituent atoms and molecules start to vibrate more vigorously. These vibrations cause the charged particles within these atoms (electrons and protons) to move and oscillate. This oscillating motion generates **electromagnetic radiation**, and a significant portion of this radiation falls within the infrared spectrum. Essentially, it's the energy of these atomic vibrations being released as infrared light.",0.37290887231406106,1

Initially, they were primarily used for counting and simple arithmetic.\n\nThe system uses letters as symbols: I (1), V (5), X (10), L (50), C (100), D (500), and M (1000). A key feature is their additive and subtractive nature; for example, VI is 6 (5+1), but IV is 4 (5-1).\n\nWhile replaced by the Arabic numeral system for most purposes due to its efficiency, Roman numerals persist in clocks, chapter numbering, and sometimes for royal names.",0.08610408057497573,1

3050,"Semester Exams-Some ways to study? Hey, I need some extra ways to help information stick in my brain for semester exams. There is a lot of information that I'm afraid i'll forget or will get mixed up with something else.","Have you tried mnemonics? it is a technique to improve memory, and it works great when you have to remember a lot of information. Just to give you an example, say you are studying the various parts of a cell and their functions:\n\nMITOCHONDRIA: site of aerobic respiration in eukaryotic cells it is a membrane bound organelle found in greater numbers in cells with high energy demands such as muscle. Made up of internal folds called cristae it is a double membraned organelle.\n\nLYSOSOME:  organelle which contains powerful digestive enzymes which are sometimes used in ""cell suicide"".  When energy flow to the membrane from the mitochondria is interrupted, the lysosome membrane ruptures releasing its contents resulting in the destruction of the cell. Found in protozoans, sperm and egg, thyroid cells, and leukocytes.\n\nNow, how will you remember their functions? Mnemonics means you associate words together to help you remember, or make up a silly/funny sentence that helps you or make up short forms. \n\nMy examples: \nmitochondria - mighty (sounds similar) - energy\nso these are related to producing energy\n\nlysosome - last days! (based on the sounds again, L and S) - suicide!\nso this is related to the destruction of the cell\n\nHere's more detail:\nMnemonic techniques are more specific memory aids. Many are based on the general memory strategies that were presented earlier. Although it can be easiest to remember those things that you understand well, sometimes you must rely on rote memory. The following techniques can be used to facilitate such memorization.\nACRONYMS. You form acronyms by using each first letter from a group of words to form a new word. This is particularly useful when remembering words in a specified order. Acronyms are very common in ordinary language and in many fields. Some examples of common acronyms include NBA (National Basketball Associations), SCUBA (Self Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus), BTUs (British Thermal Units), and LASER (Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation). What other common acronyms can you think of? The memory techniques in this section, for example, can be rearranged to form the acronym ""SCRAM"" (Sentences/acrostics, Chunking, Rhymes & songs, Acronyms, and Method of loci).\n\nLet us suppose that you have to memorize the names of four kinds of fossils for your geology class: 1) actual remains, 2) Petrified, 3) Imprint, and 4) Molds or casts. Take the first letter of each item you are trying to remember: APIM. Then, arrange the letters so that the acronym resembles a word you are familiar with: PAIM or IMAP.\n\nSENTENCES/ACROSTICS. Like acronyms, you use the first letter of each word you are trying to remember. Instead of making a new word, though, you use the letters to make a sentence. Here are some examples:\n\nMy Dear Aunt Sally (mathematical order of operations: Multiply and Divide before you Add and Subtract) \nKings Phil Came Over for the Genes Special (Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Genus, Species)","To make information stick for exams, try active recall: test yourself frequently without looking at notes. Spaced repetition is also key – revisit material at increasing intervals. Create flashcards, teach the concepts to someone else (or even a pet!), and use mnemonic devices like acronyms or visualization. Summarize chapters in your own words, and connect new information to what you already know. Vary your study methods to engage different parts of your brain, and get enough sleep!",0.2922100666512308,1

It has worked for me, for Renee Zellweger (after her Bridgett Jones movies) and for many others who need fast weight loss. Follow these steps religiously:\n\n1.Drink lots of fresh water every day using this formula: (your current weight) divided by 2 = ounces of water to consume each day. I like to drink room temperature water from a bottle because it’s easier to “chug.” I put four of the bottles on the kitchen counter and make sure they are all empty by the end of the day. Best to consume them throughout the day.\n\n2.Don’t drink any alcohol of caffeine. No soft drinks. Only green teas. REMEMBER, THIS IS ONLY 14 DAYS. YOU CAN DO IT IF YOU REALLY WANT YOUR GOAL.\n\n3.Fast walk or run for at least 60 minutes each day. It’s best to exercise in the morning since it will rev up your metabolism and keep our calorie-burn rate high throughout the day. You can do this by walking in place, using a treadmill, or walking outside. Whatever works for you.\n\n4.Do at least 50 crunches each day. I break mine into 2 or 3 different sessions. Also, if I need to do 20 crunches, I play a little trick with my mind and I “pretend” I am going to count to 25. It’s amazing how this helps the body get to all of the crunches with the same intensity.\n\n5.Eat only fresh vegetables! This is the key to the whole thing. Eat as many as you want, but DON’T eat any of the following: starchy vegetables including potatoes, squashes, pumpkins, and the like. They will work against you. Limit carrots, snow peas, and other veggies that are high in sugar content. NO GRAINS. Just fresh vegetables. You can eat salads, stir-fries, steamed, etc. But this is at the heart of your success.\n\n6.Don’t eat anything after 7:00 p.m.\n\n7.Put photographs (from magazines) up all over your house of trim, fit women. They will serve as motivators.\n\n8.Several times each day – especially when you first get up and when you go to bed, say something like: “I am enjoying my weight of (your goal weight).” Put it in the present tense and say it many times – with feeling! This will affect your subconscious mind to help you achieve your goal. Also, post these words in the same places where you post the photographs.\n\nAlso, don’t be surprised if you start feeling better than you have felt in a long time. You will have more energy, most aches and pains will be gone, and your whole body will look brighter. One warning, early on your elimination will be a little “urgent.” You may have some cramping. But this will all go away soon. Your body is in a deep cleanse.","The safest and most sustainable way to lose weight is through a combination of **diet and exercise**. This approach focuses on building healthy habits that can be maintained long-term, leading to gradual, steady weight loss and improved overall health.\n\nDiet pills and weight loss shakes can offer rapid results but often come with side effects and are not a sustainable solution.

I read a great article about a month ago (I forget where) about an animal psychologist talking about this sort of thing, how a lot of problems with pets are caused by thinking about them in human terms. For example, one woman's dog started causing havok when she got a full-time job and left him home in the house. She thought he was angry at her, but that's not something dogs could even comprehend. No, it was rather that the dog was simply very confused and didn't understand what was going on, and figuring this out saved the dog from having to be put down (he almost bit someone).\n\nBasically, no. Chimpanzees and other such evolutionary cousins might, but your common house pets cannot think that way.","While animals don't possess humor in the human sense, they exhibit behaviors that can be interpreted as playful or mischievous. A dog might dig up another dog's bone and rebury it, not out of a desire to ""joke,"" but perhaps as a form of resource guarding, a game of keep-away, or simply exploring its environment. These actions stem from instinct and social dynamics rather than a conscious intent to evoke laughter. Observing these behaviors can be amusing to humans, but it's unlikely the animal is thinking, ""This will be funny!""",0.2361977500149695,4

When their first album came out in '99 - '00 the airwaves were saturated with the likes of boy and girl singers, who were just not rock and roll by any stretch.  I think the Strokes represented a true alternative to that.  Kind of like when Nirvana came and blew away the hair metal bands.  I think The Strokes did a similar thing (though by no means are they at Nirvana's level).\n\nAnyhow, I think they are stil taken seriously because their music is rock 'n' roll.  It's edgy.

1534,what is the longest organ in our body? ,"Organs - Small intestine \n \n \n \n       \n \n\nSystem: Digestive\n\nLocation: Abdomen\n\nPhysical description: A five metre long narrow tube that hangs in sausage-like coils\n\nFunction: Chemical digestion of food and absorption of nutrients into your blood\nLongest section of your digestive tract\n\nYour small intestine is around five metres long, making it the longest section of your digestive tract. Although it is longer than your large intestine it has a smaller diameter. This is why it's called the small intestine.\n\nChemical digestion\n\nAfter food is churned up in your stomach, a sphincter muscle at the end of your stomach opens to squirt small amounts of food into the top of your small intestine. This first section of the small intestine is called the duodenum.\n\nYour pancreas releases digestive juices through a duct into your duodenum. This fluid is rich in enzymes that break down fats, proteins and carbohydrates. It also contains sodium bicarbonate which neutralises acid produced in your stomach.\n\nYour gall bladder squeezes out bile down a duct into your duodenum. Bile helps break down fats in your food.\n\nPeristalsis\n\nDigesting food is pushed through the small intestine by peristalsis. Peristalsis is a muscular movement in which alternating waves of muscle contraction and relaxation cause food to be squeezed along the digestive tract.\n\nAbsorbing nutrients\n\nMost of the nutrients in the food you eat pass through the lining of your small intestine into your blood. The lining of the small intestine is covered in tiny microvilli. These are microscopic, finger-like protrusions which give the lining of the small intestine a massive surface area for absorption of nutrients to occur across. The microvilli give the inside of the intestine the look and feel of velvet.\n\nEach microvillus contains a minute blood capillary. When nutrients are absorbed into a microvillus, they enter its blood capillary. This is how nutrients from your food enter your blood.\n\nIndigestible food passes into the large intestine\n\nBy the time food leaves your small intestine all the nutrients in your food will have entered your bloodstream. All that remains is indigestible food which is passed from your small intestine to your large intestine for further processing.","The longest organ in our body is the **small intestine**.\n\nDespite its name, it's considerably longer than the large intestine, measuring an average of 22 feet in adults. Its primary role is to absorb nutrients from the food we eat. Its incredible length allows for maximum surface area to efficiently extract vital vitamins, minerals, and carbohydrates.",0.41426056764549285,1

4445,"Did Noah really say close the door, we can't wait for unicorns.? Every year, on March 17th I hear this song played in soooo many places.  It's about unicorns (might be The Unicorn Song) and in it, Noah says to close the door and not wait for the unicorns.  Do you think that is true?","maybe what rev. trask needs is a horn on his head, the guy is and idiot, i cannot imagine anyone wanting this person for their spiritual leader.\n\nDoes the Bible support the existence of unicorns, which are mentioned in some versions?\n\nThe King James, Douay, and other versions, mention unicorns. But that is not so with modern versions that accurately render the Hebrew.—Psalm 22:21; 29:6; 92:10 (21:22; 28:6; 91:11, Douay).\n\n“People once believed that the unicorn’s horn contained an antidote for poison, and during the Middle Ages, powders supposedly made from such horns sold for extremely high prices. Most scholars believe the image of the unicorn was derived from hearsay European accounts of the rhinoceros.” (The World Book Encyclopedia) Certain Assyrian and Babylonian monuments showed one-horned animals. These are now recognized as stags, ibex, cows, and bulls depicted from the side, a view that did not show both horns.\n\nTranslators were long uncertain as to what animal was meant. The Greek Septuagint rendered re´em´ with the sense ‘of one horn,’ or unicorn. The Latin Vulgate often translates it as “rhinoceros.” Other versions use ‘wild ox,’ ‘wild beasts,’ or ‘buffalo.’ Robert Young simply transliterates the Hebrew into English as “Reem,” basically leaving the reader in the dark.\n\nModern scholars, though, have eliminated much confusion over the re´em´. Lexicographers Ludwig Koehler and Walter Baumgartner show that it means “wild oxen,” with the scientific identification Bos primigenius. This is a “subfamily of the large horned ungulate family.” The New Encyclopædia Britannica explains:\n\n“Certain poetical passages of the Old Testament refer to a strong and splendid horned animal called re´em´. This word is translated ‘unicorn’ or ‘rhinoceros’ in many versions, but many modern translations prefer ‘wild ox’ (aurochs), which is the correct meaning of the Hebrew re´em´.”\n\nSince in current English “ox” has the sense of a castrated male, the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures consistently and correctly renders re´em´ “wild bull.” The aurochs (wild ox, or bull) seems to have become extinct by the 17th century, but scientists have deduced that it was quite different from the unicorn of legend. The ancient aurochs had a body height of about six feet [1.8 m], and a length of some ten feet [3 m]. It might weigh 2,000 pounds [900 kg], and each of its two horns could be over 30 inches [75 cm] long.\n\nThis certainly accords with the Biblical mention of the re´em´, or wild bull. It was noted for its strength and intractable disposition (Job 39:10, 11) as well as its swiftness. (Numbers 23:22; 24:8) Evidently it had two horns, not one horn like the legendary unicorn. Moses referred to its horns when illustrating the two powerful tribes that would spring from Joseph’s two sons.—Deuteronomy 33:17.\n\nSo the Bible does not support the idea of unicorns as renowned in legend. It does draw an accurate, though limited, picture of the massive and fear-inspiring aurochs, or wild bull, that existed in Biblical times and down into the not-too-distant past.\n\nNO UNICORNS, PROBABLY NOAH WAS WAITING FOR THE TURTLES TO GET ON BOARD","The song you're likely thinking of is ""The Unicorn"" by The Irish Rovers, released in 1967. While the lyrics do mention Noah and a Noah's Ark scenario, Noah doesn't actually say ""close the door, we can't wait for unicorns"" in the song.\n\nThe relevant lines are: ""And all of God's creatures, great and small / Liked to hear the fiddler play so grand / And the little furry unicorn / He skipped along the docks, the happiest unicorn / While Noah said, 'Don't you mind the rain / We'll all be snug and dry in here.'""\n\nSo, while Noah is present and the ark is being boarded, he doesn't utter the specific phrase you recall. The song uses the imagery of unicorns to evoke a sense of wonder and perhaps a touch of playful absurdity in the context of the biblical story.",0.5991962740679668,1

Meaning that if we, as human beings, could have the guy/girl of our dreams they would be like the characters from our favorite anime/manga.

Length only makes sure they reach all pulleys involved. The speed of any belt is based on diameter of the pulleys they turn and the driving forces (drive pulley) to the belt.\nOf course the more or wider belts you have the better the grip to the pulleys if high torgue loads on the pulleys are expected.,"Yes, the number of belts and their length are crucial for speed computations in belt drives.\n\n*   **Number of Belts:** More belts generally mean a higher torque capacity, allowing for larger sheave ratios and thus greater speed reduction or increase potential.\n*   **Belt Length:** While belt length primarily affects tension and fit, an inappropriate length can lead to slippage. Significant slippage directly impacts the output speed, making it lower than calculated. Conversely, proper tensioning, enabled by the correct belt length, ensures optimal speed transfer.\n\nTherefore, both factors indirectly influence the actual achievable output speed based on the sheave sizes.",0.399485783801204,1

Within eleven years Eleanor bore six children; one son died in infancy. ""I suppose I was fitting pretty well into the pattern of a fairly conventional, quiet, young society matron,"" she wrote later in her autobiography. \n\nIn Albany, where Franklin served in the state Senate from 1910 to 1913, Eleanor started her long career as political helpmate. She gained a knowledge of Washington and its ways while he served as Assistant Secretary of the Navy. When he was stricken with poliomyelitis in 1921, she tended him devotedly. She became active in the women's division of the State Democratic Committee to keep his interest in politics alive. From his successful campaign for governor in 1928 to the day of his death, she dedicated her life to his purposes. She became eyes and ears for him, a trusted and tireless reporter. \n\nWhen Mrs. Roosevelt came to the White House in 1933, she understood social conditions better than any of her predecessors and she transformed the role of First Lady accordingly. She never shirked official entertaining; she greeted thousands with charming friendliness. She also broke precedent to hold press conferences, travel to all parts of the country, give lectures and radio broadcasts, and express her opinions candidly in a daily syndicated newspaper column, ""My Day."" \n\nThis made her a tempting target for political enemies but her integrity, her graciousness, and her sincerity of purpose endeared her personally to many--from heads of state to servicemen she visited abroad during World War II. As she had written wistfully at 14: ""...no matter how plain a woman may be if truth & loyalty are stamped upon her face all will be attracted to her...."" \n\nAfter the President's death in 1945 she returned to a cottage at his Hyde Park estate; she told reporters: ""the story is over."" Within a year, however, she began her service as American spokesman in the United Nations. She continued a vigorous career until her strength began to wane in 1962. She died in New York City that November, and was buried at Hyde Park beside her husband.","Eleanor Roosevelt (1884-1962) was a prominent American figure, best known as the First Lady of the United States during her husband Franklin D. Roosevelt's presidency. Far more than a traditional hostess, she was a dynamic activist and diplomat.\n\nShe championed civil rights, women's rights, and the rights of the poor, traveling extensively to witness firsthand the struggles of Americans during the Great Depression. After FDR's death, she continued her public service, notably as a delegate to the United Nations where she played a crucial role in drafting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

So far, the bird flu has only been passed from birds, either to other birds or in the isolated cases, to humans. However, if the flu mutates into a strain that can pass from human to human, people will have no immunity and the flu will probably pass rapidly from person to person, creating a pandemic. Flu vaccines can only be made to protect against a particular virus, and, since the virus has yet to be passed from human to human, no vaccine can be developed.\n\nIn Asia, many people live with ducks and chickens in their homes, and in their yards. Health and veterinary officials worldwide recently announced that a key way to stop the spread of the disease is to improve farming practices, segregating poultry from humans, and culling birds that have been infected with the deadly virus.\n\nWhat's next? When asked for predictions as to the seriousness of the pandemic, should one occur, experts have based their projections on a similar pandemic that occurred in 1918-1919. Up to a billion people fell ill, and nearly 100 million died worldwide. Translating to today's figures, they project that some 30-60 percent of the world's population could be infected by the virus, and over 300 million people worldwide could die.

","I came here because of my deep interest and affection for a land settled by the Dutch in the mid-seventeenth century, then taken over by the British, and at last independent; a land in which the native inhabitants were at first subdued, but relations with whom remain a problem to this day; a land which defined itself on a hostile frontier; a land which has tamed rich natural resources through the energetic application of modern technology; a land which once imported slaves, and now must struggle to wipe out the last traces of that former bondage. I refer, of course, to the United States of America. \n     But I am glad to come here to South Africa. I am already enjoying my visit. I am making an effort to meet and exchange views with people from all walks of life, and all segments of South African opinion, including those who represent the views of the government. Today I am glad to meet with the National Union of South African Students. For a decade, NUSAS has stood and worked for the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights--principles which embody the collective hopes of men of good will all around the world.\n\n     Your work, at home and in international student affairs, has brought great credit to yourselves and to your country. I know the National Student Association in the United States feels a particularly close relationship to NUSAS. And I wish to thank especially Mr. Ian Robertson, who first extended this invitation on behalf of NUSAS, for his kindness to me. It's too bad he can't be with us today.\n\n     This is a Day of Affirmation, a celebration of liberty. We stand here in the name of freedom.\n\n     At the heart of that Western freedom and democracy is the belief that the individual man, the child of God, is the touchstone of value, and all society, groups, the state, exist for his benefit. Therefore the enlargement of liberty for individual human beings must be the supreme goal and the abiding practice of any Western society.\n\n     The first element of this individual liberty is the freedom of speech: the right to express and communicate ideas, to set oneself apart from the dumb beasts of field and forest; to recall governments to their duties and obligations; above all, the right to affirm one's membership and allegiance to the body politic--to society--to the men with whom we share our land, our heritage, and our children's future.\n\n     Hand in hand with freedom of speech goes the power to be heard, to share in the decisions of government which shape men's lives. Everything that makes man's life worthwhile--family, work, education, a place to rear one's children and a place to rest one's head--all this depends on decisions of government; all can be swept away by a government which does not heed the demands of its people. Therefore, the essential humanity of men can be protected and preserved only where government must answer--not just to the wealthy, not just to those of a particular religion, or a particular race, but to all its people.\n\n     And even government by the consent of the governed, as in our own Constitution, must be limited in its power to act against its people; so that there may be no interference with the right to worship, or with the security of the home; no arbitrary imposition of pains or penalties by officials high or low; no restrictions on the freedom of men to seek education or work or opportunity of any kind, so that each man may become all he is capable of becoming.\n\n     These are the sacred rights of Western society. These were the essential differences between us and Nazi Germany, as they were between Athens and Persia.\n\n     They are the essence of our differences with communism today.

Many face fixed incomes that struggle to keep pace with soaring housing costs, leading to unaffordability. A lack of affordable senior housing exacerbates this.

This article will explain in more detail:,"Yes, it's true that not getting enough sleep can lead to weight gain. When you're sleep-deprived, your body produces more cortisol, a stress hormone, which can increase appetite and promote fat storage. Additionally, lack of sleep disrupts hormones that regulate hunger, like ghrelin and leptin, making you crave unhealthy, calorie-dense foods. Poor sleep also reduces your energy levels, making you less likely to exercise. This combination of increased appetite, poor food choices, and reduced physical activity can contribute significantly to weight gain.",0.18032698426082167,1

9851,What are the seven heavenly shrines? the opposite of the seven deadly sins what are the seven heavenly shrines?,":}\nThe Seven Virtues were derived from the Psychomachia , an epic poem written by Aurelius Clemens Prudentius entailing the battle of good virtues and evil vices. \n\n1.  Pride vs. Humility         Seeing ourselves as we are and not comparing ourselves to others is humility. Pride and vanity are competitive. If someone else's pride really bothers you, you have a lot of pride.\n2.  Envy vs. Love           ""Love is patient, love is kind…"" Love actively seeks the good of others for their sake. Envy resents the good others receive or even might receive. Envy is almost indistinguishable from pride at times.\n3.   Wrath/Anger vs. Kindness          Kindness means taking the tender approach, with patience and compassion. Anger is often our first reaction to the problems of others. Impatience with the faults of others is related to this.\n4. Sloth vs. Zeal           Zeal is the energetic response of the heart to God's commands. The other sins work together to deaden the spiritual senses so we first become slow to respond to God and then drift completely into the sleep of complacency.\n5. Avarice/Greed vs. Generosity        This is about more than money. Generosity means letting others get the credit or praise. It is giving without having expectations of the other person. Greed wants to get its ""fair share"" or a bit more.\n6.  Gluttony vs. Faith and Temperance     Temperance accepts the natural limits of pleasures and preserves this natural balance. This does not pertain only to food, but to entertainment and other legitimate goods, and even the company of others.\n7.    Lust vs. Self control          Self  control and self mastery prevent pleasure from killing the soul by suffocation. Legitimate pleasures are controlled in the same way an athlete's muscles are: for maximum efficiency without damage. Lust is the self-destructive drive for pleasure out of proportion to its worth. Sex, power, or image can be used well, but they tend to go out of control.","The seven heavenly shrines, often considered the opposite of the seven deadly sins, are virtues that guide one towards spiritual perfection and divine grace. They are:\n\n1.  **Humility** (opposite of Pride)\n2.  **Kindness** (opposite of Envy)\n3.  **Charity/Generosity** (opposite of Greed)\n4.  **Diligence/Temperance** (opposite of Sloth)\n5.  **Chastity** (opposite of Lust)\n6.  **Patience** (opposite of Wrath)\n7.  **Temperance/Sobriety** (opposite of Gluttony)\n\nThese virtues represent the path to spiritual fulfillment and a righteous life.",0.3386002765185482,1

This can produce heat, damaging effects, or even severe injury depending on the strength and frequency of the EMFs.\n\nIons are very important to various physiological processes, same for electron transfer.  \n\nToo much heat damages cells.\n\nTime, distance, shielding and field intensity are important factors in limiting the damages.\n\nUnder certain circumstances EMF can slowly cook a person.\n\nThere are stories about Navy people using Target Acquisition (Fire Control) radars to cook seagulls in flight.\n\nNuclear radiation can affect the nuclei of atoms in addition to the effects for EMF.\n\nYes, EMF is a type of potentially harmful radiation.  Gamma rays and light are powerful varieties of EMF.\n\nEven weak or slow EMF at lower frequencies can sometimes produce headaches and disorientation.\n\nCows in pastures have been adversely affected from both overhead and underground power lines.\n\nDeath is possible.\n\nWe live in a sea of weak EMFs.  Strong exposures can occur from nearby antennas, especially those used for broadcasting or relaying communications via radio or microwave.\n\nThere are meters available for monitoring EMF intensities.\n\nThe ionosphere and ozone layers of the atmosphere protect us from damaging rays from space.\n\nTV cameras must be wrapped in aluminum foil in some bad EMF areas.\n\nI live in a mobile home, this affords some protection too.\n\nGenerally microwaves and other shorter, more powerful wavelengths are more damaging.\n\nSunburn is a form of EMF damage.  Similarly you can see in medical work burns from other types of EMF exposure.","EMFs are energy waves that exist in various forms, like radio waves and X-rays. Non-ionizing EMFs, such as those from cell phones and Wi-Fi, have low energy and don't damage DNA. They can cause heating effects in tissues, but current research hasn't established clear health risks at typical exposure levels. \n\nIonizing EMFs, like X-rays and gamma rays, have high energy and *can* damage DNA, increasing cancer risk.

50,is gas milage better in cold weather.does gas expand giving you more.? ,"Gas mileage is usually worse in the cold weather. In the cold weather your tire pressure is lower and causes more friction with the ground. \n\nAlso the type of gasoline you put in your car is different in the summer and winter. Summer fuel is required to have a lower RVP, to mitigate evaporative emissions caused by higher temperatures. It is literally heavier, with more chemical bonds in the fuel molecules... more bonds to break = higher energy content = better MPG.\n\nAnd finally your car also faces more friction driving through cold air because the colder the air is the more dense it is.","No, gas mileage is generally **worse** in cold weather. Here's why:\n\n*   **Engine Coolant:** Cold engines are less efficient until they reach optimal operating temperature. It takes more fuel to warm them up.\n*   **Tire Pressure:** Cold air causes tire pressure to drop, increasing rolling resistance and fuel consumption.\n*   **Fuel Density:** While fuel does slightly expand when warm, the effect of this expansion on your tank's volume is negligible and doesn't lead to ""more"" fuel being measured or used. The denser cold fuel actually contains slightly more energy per unit volume.\n\nSo, while the fuel itself becomes denser in the cold, leading to marginally more energy per gallon, the increased inefficiencies outweigh this small factor, resulting in poorer gas mileage.",0.4612534495649477,1

I have seen the other frequences represented as numbers, and assumed they were all rounded, but I want to verify.\n\nA4 (standard tuning frequency) = 440 Hz","Yes.  Because the frequency of the notes are a geometric sequence with a factor of 2^(1/12) between each note, and 2^(n/12) is irrational except for when n is divisible by 12.  There are 12 half-steps in an octave.\n\nThe frequency of A (just below middle C) is 220 Hz.  So the frequency of a note that is one half-step above A is 220*(2^(1/12)).  Two half-steps up is 220*(2^(2/12)).","No, you are not correct. The statement that ""A is the only note with a rational frequency"" is false.\n\nIn music, all standard tuning frequencies are derived as rational ratios of a fundamental frequency (often A4 at 440 Hz). For example, the note C4 is approximately 261.63 Hz, which is derived from the harmonic series as a rational fraction relative to A4.\n\nThe frequencies you've seen represented as numbers are generally the precise, rational values used in tuning systems.

And ask him to come into your heart and forgive you for your sins. He will forgive you and accept you as his child. Then when you die, if you die before the Lord comes back, you will go to heaven and live with him. This is where others will be living happily and you can enjoy it with them and serve the Lord.\n\nThe other way would be going to Hell when you die. And this way is the opposite of choosing God. If you deny him, and don't believe in him, and never ask him to come into your heart, you will go to Hell and burn eternally.\n\nAnd This is the truth. You can read it in the Bible for yourself if you wish. A King James Version Bible. This is the one that they wrote over 2000 plus years ago.","What happens when we die is a profound mystery, with beliefs varying across cultures and religions. Some believe in an afterlife, a continuation of consciousness, or a spiritual rebirth. Others view death as the end of existence, a cessation of all feeling and experience.\n\nThe sensation of dying is also unknown. Some speculate it might be a peaceful fading, a brief moment of pain, or perhaps an altered state of consciousness.

Since your case has been for a number of years, it is likely that aggressive therapy is necessary.  To date, treatment is mostly confined to speech therapy which helps to improve reading, writing, and comprehension skills.

According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, patients tend to recover skills in language comprehension more completely than those skills involving expression.\n\nOn a more global level, there are a number of people who believe neural connections can be re-forged through increased usage.

This may very well be true for stroke patients.  Keep working hard and seek as much help as you can.  Best of luck.","Whether you ""get rid of"" aphasia after a stroke depends on many factors.

2950,Do Liberals really hate America? or is this a convenient way to rally the ignorant masses into simplifying an issue?,"Her's the LONG ANSWER. Don't read on if you have a limited attention span...\n\nMost Liberals don't hate America. Some do no doubt. What I think is that when some consevative talking head comes on the tube and says Liberals are baaaaad!!!!, many people swallow it. There are many impressionable people in this country who are DAMN mad and want to quench the bloodlust generated by the 9/11 attack. Capitalizing on this wave of patriotic zeal the hard core neo-cons (which are not the same as average Republicans) manipulated the entire post attack national conversation. They saw this national tragedy as a way to implement a broad and radical shift in U.S. foreign policy. The Neo-Cons were able to do this because nobody, Republican or Democrat had the balls to stand up to this radiacalism in the shadow of 9/11. The small govornment, fiscaly responsible Republicans have watched in disbelief as our budgetary spending has gone where no tax and spend Liberal ever dared take it. Inflating the budget wouldn't be so bad if it went to sensible programs for security and to update ifrastructure.But instead it is being used as thank you money in the form of ""pork barrel "" spending around the country, into the districts of those congressman and senators who vote in favor of the Neo-Con agenda.\n The term Liberal is batted around so much it's funny. What the traditional notion is referring to is a tax and spend agenda. Giving poor and underprivelaged people breaks and assistance in a multitude of areas, thus taking money from the people who earn money. These Liberals are actually really angry with the current administration for the way it uses tax breaks for the wealthy. Then using the budgetary process gives more money to the wealthy via the industrial war production inflated by the war on terror. Then it gives  no-bid contracts to companies such as KBR (Haliburten) and others connected to the Neo-Con teat.\nWhat you have is a giant spending machine where the profits keep returning to the same people. This notion has yet to sink in with most republicans. They are still too enraged by 9/11 to open their eyes to what is happening. They are being manipulated to cast out the Liberals with all of their uppity talk of Constitutional law and limited Executive power. Those aren't sexy ideas to think about and for this reason most of the ranting conservatives simply roll their eyes and shake their heads,and proclaim ""We should pitty those poor deluded Liberals"".\nWell one day (or not) the rest of the country will wake up and join the Liberals. The old fasion Reagan Conservatives will wake up the quickest. They'll wonder why G.W. hasn't seen fit to put an end to the orgy of spending. Why would we mortgage our future so a handful of companys can prosper in the near-term? That doesn't seem like conservativism. The very reason for anti-Liberal angst (out of controll spending) is the lifeblood of the current administration. Only this time the poor don't see the benefits. It is the mega-corporations getting our tax dollars without the oversight of the Congressional Budget Oversight Commitee.\nIt all boils down to this: Aside from their left wing social views, Liberals are actually doing the work of the minority in any democracy. They are trying to balance the impulse of the current leadership to gorge on as much money and power as they can before their time is up.\nThe rhetoric is so amusing. Those stupid Liberals. When will they ever learn? It seems our job as citizens isn't to think for ouselves but is to regurgitate the meaningless and empty words of our righteous benefactors the Neo-Conservative puppet masters. All of you Liberals and Conservatives should be thinking for youselves. It is a pity there are so many uneducated people in this country who speak so loudly. They try to convince the masses that it is better not to be ""smart"". ""You don't want to be like those elitist ","Whether liberals ""hate America"" is a complex question with no simple answer.

This criticism is typically rooted in a desire for improvement and a belief in the nation's potential to live up to its ideals. It's generally not a rejection of the country itself, but rather a call for it to evolve and address its shortcomings.\n\nLabeling all liberal criticism as ""hate"" oversimplifies nuanced viewpoints and can be a tool to discourage critical thinking and productive dialogue.",0.4360738850266365,1

It will usually include accounts for such items as fixed assets, current assets and liabilities, profit and loss or income and expenditure items, and funds or reserves.\n\nThe general ledger is a summary of all of the transactions that occur in the company. It is taken directly from the general journal, where each transaction is recorded.\n\nThe balance sheet and the profit/loss statement are both derived from the general ledger. Because it is organized by accounts, the general ledger allows you to observe the impact of all the transactions affecting each account at any given time. The general ledger is where posting occurs, which is the process of recording credits and debits in the general ledger. The actual balances are called the trial balance.\n\nThe general ledger should include the date, description and balance entries for each account. It is usually divided into at least five main categories. These categories generally include assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and sometimes additionally equity (liabilities held by the owners of the company). The main categories of the general ledger may be subdivided into subledgers to include details such as cash, accounts payable, accounts receivable, etc.\n\nBecause each transaction debits one account and credits another to an equal extent an accounting system will ensure that the general ledger will always be in balance unless, for example, an account (some times called a T-account) is deleted or mis-specified in the general journal.","The general ledger (GL) is the central accounting record of a company.

They reduce the number of outstanding shares, increasing earnings per share and potentially boosting the stock price. This can be tax-efficient for shareholders as they defer taxes until they sell their shares, and capital gains taxes are often lower than income taxes on dividends.\n\n**Dividends** provide a regular income stream to shareholders and signal financial health and stability. They are preferred by income-seeking investors.\n\nUltimately, the choice depends on management's view of the stock's valuation, the company's cash flow, its growth prospects, and shareholder preferences.",0,1

4035,What was the general breakdown among the Chinese immigrant community? ,"The first real wave of Chinese immigrants came to California beginning in 1848 in response to the discovery of gold. They were merchants who sold their stock to the settlers and miners and then went in search for gold themselves. They wrote home to share their experiences and by 1851 there were almost 25,000 Chinese, called ""Celestials"" for the Celestial Empire of China, on the West Coast. These immigrants were almost all from the province of Kwangtung in southern China, traveling through the harbors of Canton and Hong Kong. In rural China of the time, the purpose of life was the well-being of the family group. Many families sold possessions and/or borrowed in order to send one young man to America to make a fortune, not for himself, but to send back home to his family. The idea was to get as rich as possible as quickly as possible and then to return home. Other miners resented their lack of interest in becoming naturalized and by 1852 they were being driven from the mines. Still seeking their fortunes, many turned to jobs which the miners did not want to perform for themselves, such as cooking and laundry. By 1860 many had returned home. Then in 1862 the Union Pacific and Central Pacific cross-continental rail line began construction. A new wave of immigrants came from China through the Chinese Six Companies, organized into crews with their passage prepaid and then deducted from their monthly wages. When the railroad was completed in 1869, some Chinese returned home but for each one who returned, two more arrived. Some 123,000 came in the 1870's. The economy and political situation was against them. The Gold Rush was over and most people had failed to make their fortune. The railroad was completed, the major swamplands had been filled, and industry did not need the thousands of unskilled laborers. An agitator named Dennis Kearney organized what became the Workingman's Party in an effort to drive the immigrants away and protect American jobs. Harrassment escalated until the Exclusion Act of 1882 which was intended to prohibit the entry of Chinese laborers for ten years. Many Chinese left. Those who remained responded by moving away from the West Coast and establishing neighborhoods of their own whereever they went. Family life was the exception in these communities since most immigrants were single young men, or if married, had left their wives at home, expecting only a short stay in America. The Exclusion Laws made it almost impossible to bring family into the country. The Chinese distrusted American institutions and formed their own family associations, district organizations, and halls. Tongs were first founded as social clubs, but some, especially in San Francisco between 1880 and 1900 became involved in crime and vice. The Exclusion Laws were not repealed until the United States and China allied during World War I. Many of the original immigrants had either returned home or died, but enough remained to cause another wave of immigration as families were finally allowed to reunite. Then in 1949 the Communist takeover of mainland China caused a new wave of immigration. Unlike previous waves, many were from the educated and upper levels of society, and they brought entire families at once. This trend of educated, skilled immigrants and immigrants of all ages has continued into today.","The Chinese immigrant community in the United States was broadly divided into two main groups based on their regions of origin and dialects: **Cantonese** speakers, primarily from the southern Guangdong province, and **Mandarin** speakers, from northern China. Within these larger groups, further distinctions existed based on specific villages or districts. These differences sometimes led to distinct community organizations, social structures, and even economic specializations, though shared cultural heritage and experiences also fostered a sense of unity.",0.380073779457149,1

Do reptiles do this?,"Reptiles do not use body fat to generate heat, but they _do_ store energy as fat and use it when food supply is low, or, in the case of females, to provide nutritive substances for their eggs during the breeding season. Geckoes, for instance, accumulate fat on the basal portion of their tails. Thus the ""fat"" tail of a gecko indicates a well-fed individual.","Yes, reptiles do have body fat. Like mammals and birds, reptiles store fat as an energy reserve. This fat is particularly crucial for reptiles during periods of dormancy, such as hibernation or brumation, when food is scarce. The stored fat provides the necessary energy to maintain vital functions until they can resume normal feeding behaviors. The amount and location of fat storage can vary among different reptile species and their ecological niches.",0.43526013607270636,1

The only real drawback in OO languages is setting up this access for new objects, but these days it's hardly worth the mention. Inheritance, and the heirarchy lookup may, but it's extremely unlikely, make some slight difference.\n\nAt the end of the day, you need to store in variables what you need to store.

Over a period of six weeks, his ship captured 16 enemy vessels along the coast of Nova Scotia.\n\nIn November of 1776, he proposed a mission plan to destroy the British coal fleet and free American prisoners held at Isle Royal.  He was assigned command of the USS Alfred and successfully completed this mission, including the capture of a British ship carrying winter clothing for British troops in Canada.  This is believed to have contributed to the success of the Continental Army at Trenton by providing them with fresh winter clothes.\n\nIn June of 1777, he was given command of the USS Ranger and was sent to France to help Benjamin Franklin and the American contingent there with strategic recommendations.  After France signed a treaty with America in 1778, the USS Ranger sailed for England and captured the British naval ship, HMS Drake.\n\nIn 1779, he assumed command of the USS Bonhomme Richard.  A five ship squadron, including the Bonhomme Richard, attacked a British merchant convoy off the coast of Yorkshire.  A pair of British vessels attacked the American squadron.  Two of the vessels fled while the Bonhomme Richard and two other naval ships attacked the British warships.  The HMS Serapis severely damaged the Bonhomme Richard, shooting off her flag during the attack.  The British commander, asked if Jones had struck his colors in surrender.

That should help out a great deal.","Hangovers are primarily caused by **dehydration** from alcohol's diuretic effect. **Acetaldehyde**, a toxic byproduct of alcohol metabolism, also contributes significantly to symptoms like nausea and headaches.\n\nOther factors include:\n\n*   **Congeners:** Impurities in darker liquors can worsen symptoms.\n*   **Sleep disruption:** Alcohol interferes with quality sleep.\n*   **Gastrointestinal irritation:** Alcohol irritates the stomach lining.\n*   **Blood sugar fluctuations:** Alcohol can lower blood sugar.\n\nThese combined effects lead to the unpleasant symptoms of a hangover.",0.0734413508224594,2

Africa is a continent with thousands of languages, and meanings are tied to specific words within those languages, not to individual letters of the Latin alphabet.\n\nFor example, in Swahili, ""a"" might start the word ""asante"" (thank you), and in Zulu, ""b"" might begin ""bona"" (see). The meaning comes from the word, not the letter itself.",0.21697769913815926,2

Doesn't it end up keeping people away from your website since they simply subscribe to your data and don't have any reason to visit?\n\nYes it's good that people are reading your data (blogs, etc.) but your hits go down and ad revenue dwindles if people stop coming.\n\nIsn't that what a commecial site owner would be thinking about RSS?","Yes, and some sites provide ""partial"" feeds via RSS, requiring the user to go to the site before being able to read all the data.\n\nThe argument for full feeds more or less runs like this:  You need to entice users to your site.  By providing a full feed you are giving your users what they want, and they will be more inclined to look upon you favorably.  So rather than directly forcing eyeballs to your site, you are working on the reputation of your site for quality data, and hoping the users will pass along your site to others through bloglines or deli.cio.us, and getting new  eyeballs indirectly.","RSS benefits web designers and site owners by fostering **audience loyalty and engagement**. While direct visits might decrease, RSS ensures consistent content consumption, keeping your brand top-of-mind. This can lead to higher quality traffic when users *do* visit, as they're already invested.\n\nFor commercial sites, RSS can be a powerful marketing tool. It allows for direct communication with an interested audience, bypassing crowded inboxes. This targeted reach can be more valuable than random website hits, ultimately driving conversions and brand advocacy. The key is strategic integration, potentially using RSS to tease content and encourage further website exploration.",0.24330944696734078,3

513,What is the best strategy to pay off your debt? ,"Two strategies:  1) cut your spending, and 2) reorganize your debt.\n\n1) Try to figure out the LEAST amount you can spend, and still live.  Eliminate all fees (ATM, long distance, late fees, etc).  Cancel any frills until you are debt free (got a land line AND a cell phone?  Cancel one.  Cancel cable - you'll be amazed at the deals they will offer you to come back!)  Eat in.  Don't spend a penny on Soda/candy from a machine or coffee from a trendy coffee-bar.\n\n2)  list your debt in order, highest interest rate to lowest.  Your strategy is to eliminate the highest ones, either by moving the debt down to lower rates, or by paying it off.  \n\nI disagree with the previous answer (not to pay off credit card debt with an equity line).  Of course, this should be done with care, but this is one of the best strategies - secured debt (like an equity line) is almost always cheaper interest rate than unsecured debt (like credit cards).  ""You could lose your house"", yes, if you are stupid or not careful.  But you can also eliminate debt much quicker!  \n\nShop every rate that you have.  If you have an Equity line at Prime + 2, Shop it.  You may be able to get a Home Equity line at Prime - .75 (I just did).\n\nI believe that it's to my advantage to have debt and savings.  Low interest, tax-saving debt can be a good thing (like my Home Equity Line).  High interest debt and fees are for somebody besides me.","The best debt payoff strategy depends on your personality and financial situation.\n\n*   **Debt Snowball:** Pay minimums on all debts except the smallest, which you attack aggressively. Once it's paid, roll that payment into the next smallest. This offers quick psychological wins.\n\n*   **Debt Avalanche:** Focus extra payments on the debt with the highest interest rate, regardless of balance. This saves you the most money on interest over time.\n\nChoose the method that will keep you motivated and on track for success.",0.33926350722520715,2

This is multiple choice. The best answer is:\nFRACTURING IT or SHATTERING IT\n\nWater will cleave the rock by expanding within it as it freezes. Freezing by itself will not erode the surface (this is meant to be a chemical process) except by fracturing. It might shatter from freezing. Same process of expansion of water when freezing. Changing it's composition? No this is a chemical process, not physical erosion.  Got it?","Refreezing of water can change a rock primarily by **fracturing** it. When water seeps into cracks and freezes, it expands, exerting pressure. Repeated freezing and thawing cycles widen these cracks, leading to the rock breaking apart.\n\nThis process can also contribute to **eroding** the surface by breaking off small pieces.

It allows for greater individual freedom, diverse perspectives, and a more efficient way of living.\n\nMy preference lies in finding a **harmonious balance**.

Some do, though, which has been nice to see.","Alternative medicine carries risks, including **lack of scientific evidence** for efficacy and safety. Treatments might be **ineffective**, delaying or replacing proven medical care, leading to **worsened health outcomes**.

The government doesn't want the Chinese people to have unlimited information to the rest of the world. If they do, then the people will realize how little freedom they have compared to the US. Also by banning sites, China is banning opportunities for demonstrations/uprisings, which could lead to violence. That could lead to international attention and would cause China to lose face.","Google is banned in some countries, like China, due to **censorship and political control**. Governments often restrict internet access to prevent the spread of information that contradicts their narratives or could incite dissent. \n\nGoogle's refusal to fully comply with these censorship demands, particularly concerning user data and content filtering, leads to its blocking.
