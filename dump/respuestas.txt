Many guys, (depending on how old he is...or not) will be mean to girls they like. There was this guy in my 3 grade class with me. He kept pulling my hair & hiding my lunch. He would even say mean things to me, but it turned out that he liked me. As I grew older it seemed like the guys were just as immature. They would do the same things, but they would act wierd around a girl they liked.

There are to many variables to answer absolutly, what weight of paper are you using? (20 pound, 25 pound, 18 pound), are you using A4 or standard US paper? glossy or matte finish?\\n\\nAll of these things are needed for an answer, but if I assume that you are using standard US 20 pound matte paper (like you buy for your office copy machine) then it weights roughly 6 pounds.  I will put the formula here later.  I have it at home (how strange is that?)\\n\\n** Edit **\\n\\nO.K.  I had the formula but now I don't.  Basically it is something like this:\\n\\nyou purchase 20 pound paper, well. . . that is the weight of 1,000 sheets of 11x17 (in the US) paper, also called the M Weight (M=1,000 cute, eh?).  Now, 1,000 sheets of 11x17 is 4 reams of 8.5x11 paper.\\n\\nSo 4 reams = 20 pounds then you divide it by 4 (20/4=5) so you have 5 pounds per ream.\\n\\nRemember that is for 20 pound white uncoated paper.  If you have colored paper or coated paper, it will change and you may not have 500 sheets in a ream. (some paper comes in 480 sheet reams)\\n\\nThis formula works for 24 pound, or 110 pound and anything in between.\\n\\nHope you have the info you need.  if you need more detail, let me know by leaving more in the question.

I think McVeigh was one of those people who are looking for validation.  Because he was a little strange, a little different, he didn't get that in the mainstream of society.  So, he got in with a bunch of kooks and he looked pretty normal and as a matter of fact he could stand out and be a leader in that group of right wing conspiracy kooks.  He was relatively smart and he was also very guliible at the same time.  He was perfect lacky for the nut jobs that he associated with.\\n\\nHe was a model soldier in the U.S. Army because he was gun ho and followed orders, never questioned authority.  But when he was rejected by the Green Berets because he failed their grueling physical tests, he lost faith.  This rejection devasted him.  It created anger toward the American government and military.  He channeled his anger into right wing extremist hate groups.  The very reasons which made him a great soldier for the Army then made him a solider for right wing hate groups.

Bring it up to them, and ask them why exactly are they doing that to you?  If they are not understanding what you are talking about.

If you have already told them your feelings, then stop hanging out with them and let them see that your serious about your feelings.  A true friend is not going to do that kind of stuff anyways.

I think the reason much is made of The Strokes is that they are an "authentic" rock and roll band.  When their first album came out in '99 - '00 the airwaves were saturated with the likes of boy and girl singers, who were just not rock and roll by any stretch.  I think the Strokes represented a true alternative to that.  Kind of like when Nirvana came and blew away the hair metal bands.  I think The Strokes did a similar thing (though by no means are they at Nirvana's level).\\n\\nAnyhow, I think they are stil taken seriously because their music is rock 'n' roll.  It's edgy.  And they are a really good live act.  Of course this is all my opinion.  But if you listen to their albums, you can judge for yourself.

From what I understood in your question is that you have two objects (two frames of references), S and S'.\\n\\nEach are side by side, the first object is moving at a constant velocity, u, along the +y axis.  Meanwhile, S' moves at a constant velocity, v, at some angle away away from the y axis in the +x direction such that S and S' stay parallel with eachother.\\n\\nDiagram:\\n\\nS------S'\\nS----S'\\nS---S'\\nS--S'\\nS-S'\\nSS'\\n\\nYour question did not mention that either object was travelig anywhere near the speed of light, so we can use ordinary Newtonain relativity for this.\\n\\nIt is just common sense that since S' is moving at an angle away from S and yet stays parallel, it must be moving faster...but how much faster.\\nWe know that the +y velocity is S (u) much eqaul the +y velocity of S' (v).  So we know that,\\nv*cos(angle) = u\\nor to rearrange,\\ncos(angle) = u/v,\\nso angle = cos^-1(u/v)
The whole deal with New England was this - England and Europe were running out of natural resources such as lumber, coal, and other things.  Ships back then were made of wood, by people.  Most ships back then had an on-board carpenter and wood to make minor repairs, so ship-builders came across to New England on their own ships, and just started making more.  Even though ship building is an art that many countries didn't want to share, it's tough to live on a ship for years and not figure out how to build one.\\n\\nIn the movie, 'Master and Commander,' the original book had the Britons fighting the American Colonies and not the French, and it was an American ship that was invulnerable to the Briton's cannon fire.

Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a group of symptoms related to the menstrual cycle. PMS is linked to changes in the endocrine system, which produces hormones that control the menstrual cycle. Medical experts don't fully understand the chain of events that causes premenstrual symptoms to be severe in some women and not in others. The one direct cause that is known to affect some women is genetic: Many women with PMS have a close family member with a history of PMS.

Eddy currents traditionally can be strong enough to heat metal.  I believe the only way to cause a metal to combine with oxygen would require an electric or flame arc to vaporize the material and have enough oxygen present to "burn metal." \\n\\nON THE OTHER HAND, it was a widely used practice in the later WWII and cold war days to check radar operation by chucking welding rods in front of the radar beam and watch them flash into non-existence like a flashbulb.  The rod would be instantly changed to plasma and burn with the air.  I think if your definition of eddy current includes the current produced in a high energy RF electromagnetic field, then YES, it CAN burn metal.  Radar tubes back in the day could be in the thousands to 1 megawatt range, which would instanly destroy any metallic or RF conductive object (bird) if it got close enough to the emitter.  If you put a crinkled piece of aluminum foil in your microwave, the edges will flash and burn from the eddy currents induced by the conduction of the RF energy from the magnetron in the oven.  \\n\\nEddy currents, however, are usally NOT associated with arcs.  Eddy currents usually apply to tranformer and motor designs where electromagnets are formed with sheet steel and have windings which generate the magnetic field.  Transformer laminations are insulated from one another to PREVENT eddy currents which are very high amperage, low voltage currents induced in the armatures or cores of transformers when magnetic fields alternate in the core.  If a 60 Hz transformer, say for an old amplifier, were made of a solid block, it would waste a lot of power in the core itself because of the eddy currents.  If you construct the core with laminated sheets, the eddy currents cannot flow from sheet to sheet, so you make a more efficient design. \\n\\nI hope this helps.
Each gas has a unique set of spectral lines that serves as a spectroscopic fingerprint.  These lines, incidentally, are created through transitions of electrons from high energy states to low energy states; each transition has a unique amount of energy associated with it which translates to a photon of a particular wavelength.  Helium was discovered by subtracting out all the spectral absorption lines associated with known elements from the solar emmision spectrum, similar to the way an audio technician can enhance a vocal track by subtracting instrumental tracks one at a time.

If you want this all to be in a new mail, select all as described above, go to compose new mail, paste it on the blank page and there you go, you have your 2 mails pasted together and ready to send of, you can even add things to it if you want, scroll to the place where you want to add something, click the cursor on it and start writing.\\nGood luck I hope this works out for you.\\n\\nshortcut keys are ctrl or control + c = copy\\n                  ctrl or control + v = paste
You poor thing. My brother is a paramedic and him and his buddies all sleep in one room and one guy brought his girlfriend in and same thing. \\n\\nWell, the best you can do is talk to your roommate and ask her to PLEASE take it elsewhere. I would think they would want some privacy anyway. :S WOWEE WOW!! If your roommate gets offended that's her problem\\n\\nI am not a stool pigeon, but if it gets out of hand, you may want to complain to a counselor or someone if it gets out of hand. \\n\\nLOL Yes it is a bad wake up call. WOWWWWWWW! LOL You poor thing.
The Earth's structure is the geologic and atmospheric structure of earth.\\nContents\\n[hide]\\n\\n    * 1 Shape\\n    * 2 Structure\\n    * 3 Interior\\n          o 3.1 Interior heat\\n          o 3.2 Structure\\n    * 4 The core\\n    * 5 Mantle\\n    * 6 The Crust\\n    * 7 Hydrosphere\\n    * 8 Atmosphere\\n    * 9 Historical development and alternative conceptions\\n    * 10 See also\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nShape\\n\\nThe Earth's shape is that of an oblate spheroid, with an average diameter of approximately 12,742 km. The rotation of the Earth causes the equator to bulge out slightly so that the equatorial diameter is 43 km larger than the pole to pole diameter. The largest local deviations in the rocky surface of the Earth are Mount Everest (8,850 m above local sea level) and the Mariana Trench (10,911 m below local sea level). Hence compared to a perfect ellipsoid, the Earth has a tolerance of about one part in about 584, or 0.17%. For perspective, this is a bit more than the 0.05% tolerance allowed in billiard balls. Due to the bulge, the feature farthest from the center of the Earth is actually Mount Chimborazo in Ecuador. The mass of the Earth is approximately 5980 yottagrams (5.98 x 1024 kg).\\n[edit]\\n\\nStructure\\n\\nThe interior of the Earth, like that of the other terrestrial planets, is chemically divided into layers. The Earth has an outer silicate solid crust, a highly viscous mantle, a liquid outer core that is much less viscous than the mantle, and a solid inner core. The liquid outer core gives rise to a weak magnetic field due to the convection of its electrically conductive material.\\n\\nNew material constantly finds its way to the surface through volcanoes and cracks in the ocean floors (see seafloor spreading). Many of the rocks now making up the Earth's crust formed less than 100 million (1×108) years ago; however the oldest known mineral grains are 4.4 billion (4.4×109) years old, indicating that the Earth has had a solid crust for at least that long [1].\\n\\nTaken as a whole, the Earth's composition by mass [2] is:\\n\\n    iron: 35 .1 %\\n    oxygen: 28 .2 %\\n    silicon: 17 .2 %\\n    magnesium: 15 .9 %\\n    nickel: 1 .6 %\\n    calcium: 1 .6 %\\n    aluminium: 1 .5 %\\n    sulfur: 0 .70 %\\n    sodium: 0 .25 %\\n    titanium: 0 .071 %\\n    potassium: 0 .019  %\\n    other elements:     0 .53 %\\n\\nInterior heat\\n\\n    Main article: geothermal (geology)\\n\\nThe interior of the Earth reaches temperatures of 5650 ± 600 kelvins [3] [4]. The planet's internal heat was originally generated during its accretion (see gravitational binding energy), and since then additional heat has continued to be generated by the decay of radioactive elements such as uranium, thorium, and potassium. The heat flow from the interior to the surface is only 1/20,000 as great as the energy received from the Sun.\\n[edit]\\n\\nStructure\\n\\nEarth's composition (by depth below surface):\\n\\n    * 0 to 60 km - Lithosphere (locally varies 5-200 km)\\n          o 0 to 35 km - Crust (locally varies 5-70 km)\\n          o 35 to 60 km - Uppermost part of mantle\\n    * 35 to 2890 km - Mantle\\n          o 100 to 700 km - Asthenosphere\\n    * 2890 to 5100 km - Outer Core\\n    * 5100 to 6378 km - Inner Core\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nThe core\\n\\nThe average density of the Earth is 5515 kg/m3, making it the densest planet in the Solar system. Since the average density of surface material is only around 3000 kg/m3, we must conclude that denser materials exist within the core of the Earth. Further evidence for the high density core comes from the study of seismology. Since iron is the heaviest element that can be created by a star's fusion, the core of the earth and the other planets must be iron. All heavier elements are rare or trace. In its earliest stages, about 4.5 billion (4.5×109) years ago, melting would have caused denser substances to sink toward the center in a process called planetary differentiation, while less-dense materials would have migrated to the crust.
One difference between a Bachelors and a Masters degree are the requirements. To gain eligibility for a Bachelors, you must have at least a GED and have scored well enough on the SAT. To be eligible for a Masters Degree, you must have completed a Bachelors degree program, and adequate scores on the GRE.\\n\\nIn addition, as a Bachelors degree student, your first year or two focuses on the acquisition of general knowledge and the last few years become more specialized, focusing primarily on classes for your major/minor area. \\n\\nIn contrast, the Master's degree program takes usually only 2 years to complete and the student is only focused on learning one speciality area during that time. In addition, a Masters program requires the student to be more of an independent learner, with classes requiring much more research and independent thought.

It's not the size that is so important but how you use it. When reading a medical book it will tell you the average male is 4 to 8 inches long. So, 4 inches would be considered normal. For a woman penetration is not always the most important thing. External clitoral stimulation is just as important if not more so. Practice makes perfect!

my ideal job would be as a msw or masters in social work. in that capacity, i would like to work with at-risk-adolescents. why? because my daughter did some things when she was a teenager, that required the services of a sw, and i would like to help other adolescents, like she was helped. but also because of a bad experience with the first social worker she had, that had no compassion for anyone, and i figured i could be a better sw then he was, with no education. so far i got a b.a in that field and will soon start pursuing my masters.

It's important to get this checked out by an eye doctor. Sometimes people get floaters and it's not big deal, sometimes they go away, sometimes not, and it's not harmful. Other times, it can be a sign of something more serious. If you see any flashes of light, go immediately to a doctor (might even be cause to go to an emergency room) because that is a sign of a detaching retina (which can make you blind). In other cases, the floaters can be caused by something called neovascularization, which means new blood vessels forming in the eye. This really shouldn't happen, and can be corrected with lasers. I'm told it's not very uncomfortable. If you are diabetic,  this is a risk.\\n\\nSome causes of floaters that I am aware of: neovascularization causing distortions because the new blood vessels may cause a blind spot on the retina (laser treatment is a possibility); a small bleed in the vitreous that casts a shadow on the retina (may resolve in time, but needs to be checked still); the vitrous can pull away from the retina as a person ages, sometimes leaving a bit of debris, more common in people who are myopic (may resolve in time, not much to be done about it, but needs to be checked to make sure there isn't traction pulling on the retina, which can cause a detached retina).\\n\\nIn any case, just get it checked out right away. If there is a problem, it can probably be treated before it gets worse. Better sooner than later. Good luck.
Dental Hygienist:    There are 2 different program types to become a hygienist.  There is the associate's degree program and the bachelor's degree program.  To obtain your associate's degree in hygiene it takes approximately 2 1/2 - 3 years.... 2 years of hygiene school plus a semester or two to take pre-requisite classes.  To obtain your bachelor's degree in hygiene takes 4 years.  Once graduated from your hygiene program, you will be required to take an exam administered by your State Board of Dental Examiners that you must pass in order to receive your license to practice in your state.\\n\\nDental Assistant:    Dental assisting programs vary greatly.  They could range from about 7 months to 2 or 3 semesters.  Generally only a technical certificate is obtained to become a dental assistant.  Also, depending on the state you live in, the functions of a dental assistant vary.  Assistants are allowed to do certain things in some states that they aren't allowed to do in other states.... for one example.. packing a cord during a crown prep procedure.  There are Certified Dental Assistants and Expanded Duty Dental Assistants... tests are given once finished with schooling for both the CDA and the EDA.  An assistant is required to hold a radiology license within the state they are working in order to be able to take x-rays.
You know that is a good question but I don't know if I would. Back before I became a born again Christian I would have said in a heart beat no and why would I, sometimes even though I know God I still have that sort of thought that races through my head at times. But you have to forgive yourself and in this case they might be looking for forgiveness for what they have done or may have done to you. Really it is your choice what it is that you want to do. That is really between you and the Lord and your adopted parents and the Lord that will have to answer that question. If it was me now that I am a different person I would go and see them just to let them know that I am going to be alright. And for them let them know that peace comes for us all if you want it bad enough. My advice to you is think about this long and hard, and when you do ask your self this question what if the shoe was on the other foot and my kids knew I was dying would I want them to see me? Think about it and make sure that you yourself be right in mind and spirit when you make your decision. What I am really saying is pray about it before you do!

Sex has a number of common meanings:\\nSexual activities. \\nSexual intercourse - or vaginal intercourse; the physical act related to sexual reproduction. \\nA general topic of human or animal behavior. See human sexuality. \\nSpecies gender - a biological distinction between two or more categories (sexes), such as male and female, which combine genetic material to reproduce. Some linguists object to this use of the word gender, to avoid confusion with the word's meaning in grammar. \\nOther things named Sex or SEX include:\\n\\nSex is a 1926 play by Mae West. \\nSex is a 1991 book by entertainer Madonna and photographer Steven Meisel. \\nSex: The Annabel Chong Story is a 1999 documentary film about porn star Annabel Chong. \\nSEX was a boutique on Kings Road in the Chelsea district of London. Owned by Malcolm McLaren, it was a seminal location in the emerging punk rock scene in the mid-1970s. \\nThe "SEX" assembly language mnemonic is often used for the "Sign EXtend" machine instruction found in the PDP-11 and many other computer architectures. \\nSEX is also a good mnemonic for advice about writing essays. It stands for Sentence, Explanation, and eXample. \\nSex is an abbreviation for the constellation Sextans.\\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sex_%28disa...\\n\\nSex, in the scope of this article and category, refers to the male and female duality of biology and reproduction. The somewhat similar term gender has more to do with identity than biology. The concept is confined to organisms that reproduce sexually.\\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sex...

Before you do surgery, try a chiropractor or massage therapist.  The chiropractor may find that your spine is out of alignment, which is putting strain on the hip.

cyclooxygenase (COX)\\ncyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2)\\n\\nCox-1: Cyclooxygenase-1, a protein that acts as an enzyme to speed up the production of certain chemical messengers, called prostaglandins, within the stomach. The prostaglandins work within certain cells that are responsible for inflammation and other functions. For example, they promote the production of the natural mucus lining that protects the inner stomach. Cox-1 is normally present in a variety of areas of the body, including not only the stomach but any other site of inflammation.\\n\\n\\nCox-2 inhibitor: A type of drug that selectively blocks the enzyme cox-2 (cyclooxygenase-2). Blocking this enzyme impedes the production of the chemical messengers called prostaglandins that cause the pain and swelling of arthritis inflammation. Cox-2 inhibitors may not pose as great a risk of injuring the stomach or intestines as cox-1 inhibitors. Cox-2 inhibitors now on the market include celecoxib (brand name: Celebrex) and rofecoxib (brand name: Vioxx).

Kurds (kûrds, kʊrds) , a non-Arab Middle Eastern minority population that inhabits the region known as Kurdistan, an extensive plateau and mountain area in SW Asia (c.74,000 sq mi/191,660 sq km), including parts of E Turkey, NE Iraq, and NW Iran and smaller sections of NE Syria and Armenia. The region lies astride the Zagros Mts. (Iran) and the eastern extension of the Taurus Mts. (Turkey) and extends in the south across the Mesopotamian plain and includes the upper reaches of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers.\\nAs of the late 1990s, there were estimated to be more than 20 million Kurds, about half of them in Turkey, where, making up more than 20% of the population, they dwell near the Iranian frontier around Lake Van, as well as in the vicinity of Diyarbakir and Erzurum. The Kurds in Iran, who constitute some 10% of its people, live principally in Azerbaijan and Khorasan, with some in Fars. The Iraqi Kurds, about 23% of its population, live mostly in the vicinity of Dahuk (Dohuk), Mosul, Erbil, Kirkuk, and Sulaimaniyah.\\n\\nEthnically close to the Iranians, the Kurds were traditionally nomadic herders but are now mostly seminomadic or sedentary. The majority of Kurds are Sunni Muslims. Kurdish dialects belong to the northwestern branch of the Iranian languages. The Kurds have traditionally resisted subjugation by other nations. Despite their lack of political unity throughout history, the Kurds, as individuals and in small groups, have had a lasting impact on developments in SW Asia. Saladin, who gained fame during the Crusades, is perhaps the most famous of all Kurds.

It will usually include accounts for such items as fixed assets, current assets and liabilities, profit and loss or income and expenditure items, and funds or reserves.\\n\\nThe general ledger is a summary of all of the transactions that occur in the company. It is taken directly from the general journal, where each transaction is recorded.\\n\\nThe balance sheet and the profit/loss statement are both derived from the general ledger. Because it is organized by accounts, the general ledger allows you to observe the impact of all the transactions affecting each account at any given time. The general ledger is where posting occurs, which is the process of recording credits and debits in the general ledger. The actual balances are called the trial balance.\\n\\nThe general ledger should include the date, description and balance entries for each account. It is usually divided into at least five main categories. These categories generally include assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and sometimes additionally equity (liabilities held by the owners of the company). The main categories of the general ledger may be subdivided into subledgers to include details such as cash, accounts payable, accounts receivable, etc.\\n\\nBecause each transaction debits one account and credits another to an equal extent an accounting system will ensure that the general ledger will always be in balance unless, for example, an account (some times called a T-account) is deleted or mis-specified in the general journal.

Study Highlights Key Elements Of Successful Poverty Reduction\\nNovember 3, 2005 — A new World Bank report concludes that reducing poverty at scale depends on several factors including leadership and commitment, institutional innovation, learning and experimentation, external catalysts such as donor assistance and sometimes even economic shocks. "Reducing Poverty on a Global Scale: Learning and Innovating for Development" draws on more than 100 case studies of poverty reduction worldwide. World Bank analysts have identified the main factors that help or hurt in reducing poverty at scale, and what this means for World Bank and donor operations\\nGo to link to find out more!

The median profits per partner figure at America's 100 top-grossing law firms in 2003 was $792,500, up almost 9.3 percent from 2002. The average was even more astonishing: $930,700, up about 10 percent. Ten years ago, million-dollar partner paydays were limited to two or three firms. No more. Thirty-two of the firms on this year's chart enjoyed average profits per partner of $1 million or more, and they aren't just the usual New York and Los Angeles suspects. Bingham McCutchen, Dechert, and Howrey Simon Arnold & White were all over $1 million for the first time, each with profitability jumps of 14 percent or more. Partnership was very, very good to a lot of big-firm lawyers in 2003. \\n-- taken from the article referenced below.\\n\\nNote that these are averages for partners, generally, at these firms, not managing partners, who tend to make at the top of the scale.

One is eligible to take the bar exam with only law-office study in California, Maine, New York, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, and Wyoming. In addition, you are eligible in California, DC, and New Mexico to take the test if you only have correspondence study. Each state is very different on these requirements, particularly on how long you must work at a law firm, and some of those do require some classroom experience at an ABA accredited law school, even though they don't require a JD or LLD.\\n\\nThat being said, it is pretty rare for someone to apply for and be accepted to the bar without a law degree. It is simply the easiest, fastest way to learn all of the information necessary for the bar exam.

Maple Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD) is an inherited metabolic disorder, that, if untreated, causes mental retardation, physical disabilities and death.  First described as a disease in 1954, it is a rare disorder, believed to be in all ethnic groups worldwide.  The national incidence is 1 in 225,000 births.  \\n\\nMSUD derives its name from the sweet, burnt sugar, or maple syrup smell of the urine.  The disorder affects the way the body metabolizes (processes) certain components of protein.  Amino acids accumulate in the blood causing a toxic effect that interferes with brain functions.  The symptoms of classic MSUD are usually evident within the first week of life. The first symptoms in an infant are poor appetite, irritability, and the characteristic odor of the urine.  Within days they lose their sucking reflex and grow listless, have a high-pitched cry, and become limp with episodes of rigidity.  Without diagnosis and treatment, symptoms progress rapidly to seizures, coma, and death.  In some variant types, failure to thrive may be the first sign.  The earlier these children are diagnosed and treated, the less risk of permanent damage.\\n\\nTreatment of children with MSUD must be started as soon as possible, preferably at birth.  It involves a complex approach of maintaining metabolic control.  A special, carefully controlled diet is the focus of daily treatment.  This requires careful monitoring of protein intake and close medical supervision.  The diet centers around a synthetic formula  or "medical food" which  provides nutrients and all the amino acids except leucine, isoleucine and valine.  These three amino acids are added to the diet with carefully controlled amounts of food  to provide the protein necessary for normal growth and development without exceeding the level of tolerance.  \\nVarious tests are available to monitor the levels of the amino acids and their keto acid derivatives in the blood and urine.  Illnesses and stress, as well as consuming too much protein, raise these levels.  Even mild illnesses can become life‑threatening.  A metabolic imbalance requires dietary changes and at times hospitalization.
The freezing point of a pure substance can be derived from a cooling curve plotting the temperature versus time.\\n\\nAs energy is taken out of a liquid, its temperature falls.  When the temperature reaches the freezing point of the substance, energy is taken out, but the temperature remains constant.  At this point, the cooling curve levels out this is quite evident when looking at the graph.\\n\\nThis leveling off effect is seen because in order for the substance to free, additional energy must be removed from the liquid, this is called the latent heat of fusion.  After the substance is frozen, the temperature of the solid can continue to drop.\\n{this same effect can also be seen as something melt, boils, condenses, or sublimes}

MySQL is a popular open source SQL (Structured Query Language) database implementation, available for many platforms, including Windows, Unix/Linux and Mac OS X.\\n\\nMySQL is a relational database management system, which means it stores data in separate tables rather than putting all the data in one big area. This adds flexibility, as well as speed. The SQL part of MySQL stands for "Structured Query Language," which is the most common language used to access databases. The MySQL database server is the most popular open source database in the world. It is extremely fast and easy to customize, due to its architecture. Extensive reuse of code within the software, along with a minimalist approach to producing features with lots of functionality, gives MySQL unmatched speed, compactness, stability, and ease of deployment. Their unique separation of the core server from the storage engine makes it possible to run with very strict control, or with ultra fast disk access, whichever is more appropriate for the situation.
try taboo\\nWHAT to eat for losing weight\\n\\n• Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables, especially NC (negative calorie) food.\\n\\n* Print these lists. They will be your ... "Bible", from now on !\\n* Dill and parsely - include them in all your salads. Also ognion + garlic.\\n* Try eat mostly fresh vegs & fruits (whenever possible, of course)\\n* If you really want a book, then check this out: The Negative Calorie Diet Workbook & Cookbook - eBook (Win95/98 only). Read more about this e-book here.\\n\\n\\n• Eat fish, chicken, beef, pork. (preferences are in this order)\\n\\n* If you are a vegetarian, then ignore this!\\n* Avoid fat meat\\n\\n\\n• Eat 2-3 slices of bread/day. Don't EVER exclude bread from your diet!\\n\\n• Snacks between meals (if needed): apples, oranges, grepfruits and other NC fruits\\n\\n* Don't cheat ... NO cookies, chips, candies, brownies etc! \\n* EVEN if they have "low fat" indication... They might have low fat, yet they can have lots of CALORIES !!!\\n\\n\\n• About rice, potatoes, beans, [xxx]nuts, pastry, pasta... you know!\\n\\n* Don't eat too much of those, at least during the first weeks of the diet. I'm not a low carb addict, but I've noticed weight gains if consuming those in large quantities, especially when associated with other foods.\\n* If you like them a lot, try and eat them like one meal. A nice delicious plate of spaghetti could be your lunch (never dinner!), followed by a nice big apple. These rich starch foods are not good for dinner!\\n* At dinner time, chose mainly large mixed veggies salads... with fish, lean meat or cheese (if you are not a vegetarian). \\n\\nif u want to lose weight the best food to it are baked potatoes with nothing on it. no salt no nothing just plain. u can eat a 10000000000 baked potatoes till ur stuff and not gain a pound. i heard that from a weight loss tape. the best drink is water or gatorade. thats a start then when you work out do some taeboo. if u want a macine. run with dumbells on a treadmill. u could do the rocky workout. but thats a new story. u could use a butterfly macine i think it works the abs\\n\\n1) It is not just the amount you eat, but what you eat. Lean meats and vegtables that snap are a good place to start. And by snap I mean fresh and not boiled or doused with better or whatever.\\n\\n2) Exercise moderatly but for about an hour every other day. Spend half of that walking or running at a good enough pace for you to feel labored. The other half of the time use weights, or exercises such as push ups or situps to get a muscle "burn". A gym is also an option, but I don't know if you have the money for or want to spend the money on it.\\n\\n3) Sleep well. To bed earlier and up earlier. Exercise in the morning when you wake up, not in the evening before bed. 7 hours of GOOD sleep is a must.\\n\\n4) Occupy yourself with a hobby that keeps your attention for a long period of time. A hobby like this keeps your mind focused and gives less of a chance for snacking from boredom.\\n\\nThat is a good place to start... if you see good results, keep it up and modify to fit you... if it does not, see a doctor AND a trainer \\n\\nKeep working out, drink water a lot, eat 5 to 6 meals a day but in small quantities, vegtables are important specially cucumber and lattice, fruits not be eaten after meals except by 2 to 3 hours, minimize the starch quantities in your meals lots of salad is important, your last meal must be before you sleep by 2 to 3 hours\\nthe most important thing is you don't lose patient wait and have a strong will to be as what you want\\n\\nyou might have some more ideas from www.ivillage.com\\n\\ngood luck

Innovation in technology, creativity, new solutions might be powerful for many companies, specially these days. We introduce an article "The key to progress" by G. Haesen, F. Fernández, J-C. Venchiarutti.\\n\\n"In traditional industries many processes could be made more efficient and less environmentally harmful, but resistance to change often leaves new ideas on the shelf. Sharing knowledge and experience of new techniques is critical to their acceptance, as the case of the printing industry –\\nwhere the Subsprint project has helped introduce new methods for cleaning presses – shows.(...)Estimates indicate that offset printers in the European Union use around 100 million litres of organic solvents per year to clean their presses. According to experimental evidence, somewhere between 60\\nand 90% of these petroleum-based solvents evaporate into the atmosphere, making the printing industry Europe’s second biggest industrial emitter of\\nvolatile organic compounds (VOCs). VOCs in the atmosphere contribute to the thinning of the ozone layer and create smog at ground level; they can also be\\ndamaging in soil or water. Print workers inhale organic solvents throughout their work, with the highest exposure levels experienced while cleaning presses. VOCs are known to have harmful effects on lungs, kidneys, liver and skin, and may also affect the nervous system. Replacing the traditional organic solvents with vegetable-oil-based cleaning products\\n– which are generally biodegradable\\n– would not only reduce environmental\\ndegradation but would also have significant benefits for the health of print workers. Subsprint was one of the first technology transfer projects supported by the EU, launched in 1993, and it aimed to encourage the substitution of organic solvents in the printing industry with vegetable cleaning agents (VCAs).(...)With the accompanying measures launched within the Fifth Research\\nFramework Programme, we aimed to set up a pilot platform to support the sharing of knowledge. It became clear immediately that the diverse backgrounds\\nof team members and the different business sectors involved made it necessary to define a common language during the design of the platform. Such a common language should streamline the knowledge transfer process by facilitating\\ncommunication, and by uncovering similarities and differences which may be\\nleveraged in the sharing process. This process has substantially succeeded,\\nalthough the partners had to overcome significant obstacles before they came to acknowledge fully the importance of trust in the knowledge transfer process. Today, more than ever, firms rely on information and knowledge exchange to facilitate the uptake of new technologies, processes and approaches. Haesen believes that companies aiming for success in the knowledge-based economy must become learning organisations, focused on efficiently acquiring knowledge from sources such as research – on both technical and non-technical sources – consultants, strategic partnerships with other companies, and the knowledge of their own employees. Protecting investments through patents is a short-term solution, but sharing knowledge is an essential step for organisations to become competitive."

Baptism doesn't save you, only God/Jesus/The Spirit does that.  Baptism is an open declaration of your love and submission to God.  If you want to reaffirm your statement to your church and friends, they will always let you do so, and if you want to be rebaptised, talk to your pastor to see if he is comfortable with doing so.  I can't see why he wouldn't, and if it will help give you peace, I say go ahead, but please know, if you have given your life to God, you are saved, and baptism is only to show others of your promise to God.

It doesn't really have a purpose in the since that a firefighter has a purpose, but there are consequences of its being there.\\n\\nThe moon formed when the proto-earth was hit by a Mars sized asteroid during the very early years of the solar system - about 4.5 to 5 billion years ago. The resulting collision knocked a bunch of stuff into orbit around the Earth. That stuff quickly accreted together and the moon was formed.\\n\\nBecause the Earth has a (relatively speaking) large satellite there are a couple of consequences. Tides are the obvious one. But more important is that the gravitational attraction between the Earth and the Moon provide a weak link, but enough of a link that the Moon stabilizes the Earth's rotation. Right now our axis of rotation is about 23.5 degress tilted with respect to our orbital plane. It has probably always been close to this. \\n\\nWithout a large Moon, the small gravitational tugs from the other planets can lead to an instability where the axis of rotation (relatively) suddenly shifts - maybe from 23 degress to 85 degrees. This sort of jump has probably happened on Mars.\\n\\nIt is quite possible - though this is speculative - that because the Earth has never had its axis shift a great deal that the climate has always been stable enough for animals and plants. \\n\\nIn other words, without the Moon, it is quite possible that only algae and other primitive creatures would exist on Earth.

It cames from Maccabees (in hebrew the group of these rebels its called maccabiim it ends with im because is the plural name, if you talk about a single male rebel of this group is called maccabi) who were were Jewish rebels who fought against the rule of Antiochus IV Epiphanes of the Hellenistic Seleucid dynasty, who was succeeded by his infant son Antiochus V Eupator. The Maccabees founded the Hasmonean royal dynasty and established Jewish independence in the Land of Israel for about one hundred years, from 165 BCE to 63 BCE.\\n\\nIn 167 BCE, a Jewish priest, Mattathias, started the revolt against the Seleucid overlords of Judea by refusing to worship the Greek gods and slaying the hellenistic Jew who stepped up to worship the idol in place of Mattathias. He and his five sons fled to the wilderness. After Mattathias' death about one year later, his son Judas Maccabaeus led an army of Jewish dissidents to victory over the Seleucids. After the victory, he entered Jerusalem in triumph and religiously cleansed the Temple, reestablishing traditional Jewish worship there. Every year Jews celebrate Hanukkah in commemoration of Judas Maccabeus' victory over the Seleucids.\\n\\nThe story of the Maccabees can be found in the deuterocanonical books of 1 Maccabees and 2 Maccabees. Books of 3 Maccabees and 4 Maccabees also exist, though they are not directly related to the Maccabees.\\n\\nThe name "Maccabee" is sometimes seen used as synonym for the entire Hasmonean dynasty, but the Maccabees proper were Judas Maccabeus and his four brothers. The name Maccabee was a personal epithet of Judas, and the later generations were not descendants of him

For me, serendipity is something that comes into my life just when I seem to need it.\\n\\nIt could be a person, a piece of information, a "sign" that tells me I'm making the right decision.  For instance, when we bought a previous home, we knew we would get it because my wife was pregnant and the cross street was "Concepcion" (conception).  Another time, the house we made an offer on was on Solana and, when we had dinner at Chili's that night, they had "Solano Steak" on the menu.  We got the house.\\n\\nDo I really believe in "signs" from some divinity? No. I just believe that these events are constantly happening but we only register them when we are ready to receive them.  That doesn't dimish the effect of serendipity because it makes life fun and interesting.

I wish I could say that I'm equally versed in all of them, but to tell you the truth I'm more of a 'jack of all trades'. I love to dabble with anything that catches my interest and always strive to try something new to expand my knowledge and understanding (and, of course, trying to have as much fun as possible along the way). \\n\\nMy background is fairly varied and straddles both development and design: I did two years of Computer Sciences (at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich), but found it far too academic and uninspiring. After working as an assistant for a professional photographer for a few months, I upped sticks, moved to the UK, and switched to a Graphic Design course, followed by a Masters in Creative Technology. \\n\\nIf I had to choose one of the areas that I'm most comfortable working in, I'd have to settle for photography. I've been shooting since I was about 16 years old, and I have, in the last few years, also started collecting older cameras (I've nearly completed my collection of all of Canon's A and F series). Despite my other interests in digital technology, I still prefer to use real film - mostly black and white. There is a certain quality to the analogue medium (such as black and white film's response to light, and the very natural looking grain you get at 400 ASA and above) and the 'craft' involved in manual shooting and working around film's limitations that I'm passionate about.

skyman,\\n\\nthis is kind of a big question since there are very very many different kinds of lasers that work very differently.  i'll try to answer it in a general way.\\n\\nLASER stands for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation.  i'll get to exactly what that means in a minute.\\n\\nthe earliest laser was a rod of ruby crystal, with mirrors on both ends with the shiny faces pointing towards the crystal, and some very bright flashbulbs around the sides.  one of the mirrors was a perfect mirror - 100% of the light was reflected - and the other was not quite - 99% or so was reflected but about 1% passed through.\\n\\nthe way it worked was that you'd fire the flashbulbs, which would shine very brightly into the ruby crystal.  all the atoms in the ruby absorb some energy from the light and their electrons go to a higher-energy state - this is called a "population inversion" and is important to the operation of a laser.\\n\\nanyway, before long some of those atoms will start emitting photons and settling back down into their ground state.  some photons will be going the right direction so that they bounce back and forth between the mirrored ends of the rod, over and over.  \\n\\nevery time a photon goes past an excited atom, it causes the atom to radiate a photon too, in the same direction and in phase with the original photon.  this is the "stimulated emission" in LASER.  before long this cascades into a torrent of photons, all bouncing back and forth between the mirrors - about 1% of them leak out and you get a laser beam.\\n\\nthere are a lot of other designs for lasers, but they all work on the same fundamental principle.  you have some kind of material that can emit photons when it's in an excited state, and you put it between two mirrors in what is called an optical resonator or optical cavity.  of course there are a lot more technical details that i'm skipping over, but hopefully you get the basic idea.

Artificial Insemination (spelled correctly there) would be your best bet.  In AI, you could be the carrier of the baby and have the sperm of your hubby/partner harvested and inserted into you.  There is another kind of option in AI wherein both the egg and the sperm is harvested in both partners but a 3rd party will carry the baby if the female egg-donor is incapable of carrying the child herself.  \\n\\nOf course, adoption would be another option.
BDSM is an umbrella term that encompasses a large and varied spectrum of lifestyle preferences.  These can range from a couple engaging in a little kinky play in the bedroom, to a real-time 24/7 Master/slave relationship.  As such activities become more popular, they have also become more socially acceptable (to some extent), thanks to movies like "The Secretary" and TV shows like "CSI."  I think you might be surprised to find out how many people engage in some form of the lifestyle, once inside the privacy of their own homes and bedrooms.  Most of the literature that I've seen on the subject coincides with the previously-given figure of 10% of the population or so.

Most vertebrates have their own internal milieu, that is, we maintain constant concentrations of ions and water that are different from those of the environment. This is achieved by means of the osmoregulatory system, which includes the kidneys but also, in the case of fishes, special excretory tissues in the gill area.\\nSome fishes (cartilaginous ones) do indeed maintain a high internal concentration of salts as part of their osmoregulatory mechanism:  it's not sodium chloride, however, but urea, and therefore their meat is stronger-tasting and has a salty smell.
It might not be easy because you still have feelings for her, but you clearly should move on. Actions speak louder than words.

Just wondering since they tend not to be so big on environmental issues...\\n\\n____________\\nCarter, FYI the biological species concept definition of a species (the one you attempted to apply to humans) isn't actually used anywhere outside of a high school classroom.  Lions and tigers and interbreed (and produce fertile offspring), as can wolves and cyotes.  However, I don't think anyone would argue that lions and tigers are the same species.  You've arrived at the correct conclusion, but for the wrong reasons.\\n\\nOh, and Homo sapien is two words, although the proper name for modern humans is actually Homo sapien sapien.\\n\\n_________\\n>>>"put it on the endangered species list" as in, genocide, \\n\\nWhat???  That doesn't make sense.  The endangered species list is a list of species we're protecting, not species we're trying to eliminate.  Putting a species on the endangered species list make it illegal to kill members of that species under most circumstances.\\n\\nTo answer you question about genocide, however, what stops genocide now?  I don't see where it would be any different if we were talking about a group that is officially a separate species.  Although, species being driven to extinction or "exterminated" is usually look upon as a *bad* thing, so I don't see where their being a separate species is an inherent justification for genocide, although I think it would be human nature to use it as such.\\n\\n\\n_______\\nThanks for pointing that out, Calimecita, I went back and capitalized the genus names.

Contact your cable provider first as some do not permit the use of privately owned modems, or use proprietary cable modem technologies not available on the market (few but some).  If they will allow it, ask if it needs to be DOCSIS 1.0, 1.1, or 2.0 compliant as different cable services have varying requirements.  \\n\\nIf they provide a modem, make sure, once you receive the modem and setup your service you have them "provision" the modem on their network as it is likely they will have provisioned theirs already for you.  Provisioning assigns the address of your new modem to your cable connection, otherwise the new modem will not be "allowed" to communicate on their network.  Also, make sure to return the modem they provide, and have them cancel your rental fees!

Everyday. I am 23 years old. I can shoot with both feet. I can dribble and run as fast as slim boys. I am overweight by 30 kilograms, about 75 pounds. I weight 230 pounds and my height is 5'10'' (1 meter and 78 centimeters). I have a wide body from the pectorals to the legs. This made easier for me to dribble, the other players just will hit against my body as if it were a wall.\\n\\n   I also can header the ball with real strenght. The main way to do this is to run from a point were the ball is not pointed directly to you. For example, ask your friend (the one who is centerin the ball to pass the ball to a point in front of you) always have in mind that the his pass must be not really fast, otherwise you will not reach the ball. Then, jump curling your body in a > greater than sign form, try to get a good position before trying this jump. Next, curl your body to a smaller than position < sign form. Got it.? I hope so.\\n\\n   To shoot with real precision (accuracy) you do not need to hit the ball hard nor use your toes. Just hit the ball with the interior side of your foot. To shoot blazing shoots just run as fast as you can and hit the ball with the upper side of the foot. If your feet are big, try to inclinate your body to the opposite side the ball is being shoot from. From example if you shoot using the right foot inclinate your body to the left as much as you can. \\n\\n  There is another way to shoot really hard. Run towards the ball and while you shoot, jump so your foot will not hit the ground. Like this . /| (the point here represents the the ball, the slash represents the shooting foot and the vertical line represents the other leg, which is known as the point of support for your body).\\n\\n  I hope this will help you improve your soccer abilities. :D Maybe you do not need to improve, but I gave you these tips anyway.

I do. I'm not religious, and the thing I belive in is each individual. You are your only owner and therefor you sexand your sex desires belong only to yourself, so if you want to practice sex and are old enough, mature enough and you've taken all the precautions you can have sex whenever you want to. Some people think sex belongs to marriage, some others believe that one should only have sex with someone they love (that's my case) and some others think it is ok to have sex with whoever you want to if both of the partners agree on it. From my opinion, all the choices are as respectable. Nobody is morally superior for waiting to have sex until marriage, that is just a personal decission that has to be respected.

Organs - Small intestine \\n \\n \\n \\n       \\n \\n\\nSystem: Digestive\\n\\nLocation: Abdomen\\n\\nPhysical description: A five metre long narrow tube that hangs in sausage-like coils\\n\\nFunction: Chemical digestion of food and absorption of nutrients into your blood\\nLongest section of your digestive tract\\n\\nYour small intestine is around five metres long, making it the longest section of your digestive tract. Although it is longer than your large intestine it has a smaller diameter. This is why it's called the small intestine.\\n\\nChemical digestion\\n\\nAfter food is churned up in your stomach, a sphincter muscle at the end of your stomach opens to squirt small amounts of food into the top of your small intestine. This first section of the small intestine is called the duodenum.\\n\\nYour pancreas releases digestive juices through a duct into your duodenum. This fluid is rich in enzymes that break down fats, proteins and carbohydrates. It also contains sodium bicarbonate which neutralises acid produced in your stomach.\\n\\nYour gall bladder squeezes out bile down a duct into your duodenum. Bile helps break down fats in your food.\\n\\nPeristalsis\\n\\nDigesting food is pushed through the small intestine by peristalsis. Peristalsis is a muscular movement in which alternating waves of muscle contraction and relaxation cause food to be squeezed along the digestive tract.\\n\\nAbsorbing nutrients\\n\\nMost of the nutrients in the food you eat pass through the lining of your small intestine into your blood. The lining of the small intestine is covered in tiny microvilli. These are microscopic, finger-like protrusions which give the lining of the small intestine a massive surface area for absorption of nutrients to occur across. The microvilli give the inside of the intestine the look and feel of velvet.\\n\\nEach microvillus contains a minute blood capillary. When nutrients are absorbed into a microvillus, they enter its blood capillary. This is how nutrients from your food enter your blood.\\n\\nIndigestible food passes into the large intestine\\n\\nBy the time food leaves your small intestine all the nutrients in your food will have entered your bloodstream. All that remains is indigestible food which is passed from your small intestine to your large intestine for further processing.

Triple-Initial Monograms: It is customary to specify initials in the following order: first name, last name, middle name.

First of all what you need to do is go get yourself pre-approved for a mortgage!!!  That should have been the very first step before you even started looking at condos. I'm surprised any lenders would accept such a deposit without approving you completely for the loan!\\n\\nNext, 680 is fairly average for a credit score (not great, but definitely not bad). They will mainly take that score into consideration for your interest rate (which could really only fluctuate about .3 percent). Income level is good, but considering the cost of the condo, combined with other expenses (car payments, insurance, taxes, credit cards, any other loans or pre-existing monthly bills), I could say with confidence that 15 year mortgage is NOT the way to go. \\n\\nThey won't take the rent for the other bedrooms into consideration, unless you have a lease signed by tenants, and the income is GUARANTEED to come in. Otherwise, who knows if you'll really find someone to rent those out or how long it will take TO find someone. \\n\\nTalk to your real estate agent (and please tell me you have one with such an expensive condo). Figure out your finances and GOOD LUCK! :)

This prevents them from being induced onto the transmission line and causing weak/distorted signals at the termination.  I hope that helps.\\n\\nP.S. -  Never tie both ends of the shield to earth...it causes an earth loop which shows up as a ghost image of the original transmission that is out of phase (sync) with the original.

Huh? I'm not sure what your first langauge is, but your question makes no sense whatsoever in English.\\n\\nI'm trying to decipher it and I THINK you might be trying to ask about herd immunity. Does that sound right?\\n\\n____\\n>>>>Immunity outside would consits of skin, \\n>>> nostrils and fillaments within the ears.\\n\\nNo, it wouldn't. Those aren't immunity, they are simply barriers. Nostrils aren't even that, they are just holes.\\n\\nI think perhaps you should find a dictionary and look up "immunity".

You need 2 lights to get contrast.  Set one at 10 O'clock and one at 7 o'clock.  Put a difuser (white paper) in front of the 7 o'clock lite (you want half the light from that one).  Use a background with a single strong color (not the same as the product) that you can select in Photoshop to delete out the background.  Support the product on a rod (stick it on using putty) that is behind the product so it does not show.  Keep the background as far away as possible and use as large an f stop as you can while keeping the whole product in focus.  That's about it!
i have one of each color but blue is my favorite and i use theat one the most
Cohens v. Virginia \\nCohens v. Virginia, 19 U.S. 264 (1821), was a United States Supreme Court decision most noted for the Marshall Court's assertion of its power to review state supreme court decisions in criminal law matters. The Court had previously asserted a similar jurisdiction over civil cases in Martin v. Hunter's Lessee, 14 U.S. 304 (1816).\\n\\nIn this case, the Cohens were prosecuted successfully by the state of Virginia for selling lottery tickets from the District of Columbia in Virginia, thereby violating Virginia state law. The Supreme Court upheld their convictions.\\n\\n\\nSee also\\nList of United States Supreme Court cases \\n\\nReferences\\nJean Edward Smith, John Marshall: Definer Of A Nation, New York: Henry Holt & Company, 1996. \\n\\nExternal links\\nLII: full text of Cohens v.

Ray Nagin was democratically elected as Mayor of New Orleans. If he were for some reason removed from office, then the deputy mayor would be in charge. That is how 'democracy' works.\\n\\nIf you are looking to put the blame on what happened before, during and after Katrina. A large percentage should be put on the local and state government.

Everyone was caught up in their beaurocractic bs and failed to realise the urgency of the situation.\\n\\nReminds me of Love Canal..
Well fertility has to do with how many babies, or new people, there are. Death lowers the amount of people we have. Migration is when people come to another place, affecting the amount of people there. Good environmental conditions can raise fertility, people like to move to nice areas, and crappy areas might cause death, if there is too much radiation, smog, etc.

The President of the United States of America (often abbreviated to "POTUS") is the head of state of the United States. Under the U.S. Constitution, the President is also the chief executive of the federal government and Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces.\\n\\nBecause of the superpower status of the United States, the American President is widely considered to be the most powerful person on the earth, and is usually one of the world's best-known public figures. During the Cold War, the President was sometimes referred to as "the leader of the free world," a phrase that is still invoked today.\\n\\nPowers and Dueties of the President of the United States \\nThe President, according to the Constitution, must "take care that the laws be faithfully executed." To carry out this responsibility, the president presides over the executive branch of the federal government; a vast organization of about 4 million people, including 1 million active-duty military personnel. A President-elect will make as many as 6,000 appointments to government positions, including appointments to the federal judiciary. The Senate must consent to all judicial appointments as well as the appointments of all principal officers. The President may veto laws made by the United States Congress but cannot personally initiate laws. Congress can overturn the veto with a two-thirds majority in both houses. He is Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces and may make treaties, but the Senate must confirm these. The political scientist Richard Neustadt said, "Presidential power is the power to persuade and the power to persuade is the ability to bargain". He was commenting on the fact that the President's domestically constitutional power is limited, despite the modern expectation of Presidents to have a legislative program, and successful bargaining with Congress is usually essential to Presidential success.\\n\\nas for perks well that would be Command, Salary, Service, Meting People, & Fullfillmetn of Goals Set
I think on the daily show they answered this question. 2 points.
OK first, answer this question\\nHow much of a "people person am I?"\\nsecond, are you willing to sacrifice for others.\\nThe best witness of the gospel is to become the living gospel by living it out daily infront of others.\\nI have tried preaching but a life lived out for all to see works sometimes way better.\\nLove beyond and exceedingly no matter what. nothing and I mean absolutly nothing tells the gospel better than true love!\\nAlso here's a piece of advice, Look up 1 Corinthians 13 and for every word where it sais "Love" replace it with God and you get an idea of His true nature and charactor. next do the same but place your name in there and see if you are all those things. Patient, Kind, believeing, hopeing and so on. Learn to love and develope your heart for God and for others. Get close to God daily.

Why Would One Want to Be an Addition Symbol?\\nSince you did already a good job, let me try to help you out, if you like this. \\n\\nMy recommendation is thinking outside the box, if this is appreciated in your school. You may want to think of what the addition symbol stands for in other areas! Think of architecture, children's play, mythology, religion etc. If you get going, you could write an entire book on this little symbol!\\n\\nExamples: The addition symbol as such is very balanced: the horizontal line is equal to the vertical line. In symbolism the horizontal line stands for the earth and the vertical line for heaven. The addition symbol unites heaven and earth. I like to be balanced and feel oneness. \\n\\nThis symbol also stands for the four directions in Native American symbolism, it indicates the four directions of the wind, and the wind is fee. I like to be free. It also stands for the four corners of the world, which means, it expands worldwide, is not limited, and I like this.\\n\\nWhen tilted 45 degrees, it becomes the solar cross, indicating the points of sunrise and sunset (solstices) in the year and stands for the sun. It is nice to be like the sun: warming and enlightening the earth and allowing life to grow.\\n\\nYou may want to find your own additional reasons why you want to be an addition symbol. \\nKeep up the good works and have fun!\\n\\nCordially, India.Magica

The Sabbath is on the seventh day of the week, which is Saturday. It starts on the eve of Saturday [or Friday evening] and ends on the eve of Sunday.\\n\\nSunday became the state-sanctioned church's "official" day of worship of the then new church, the Roman Catholic Church, when Emperor Constantine declared it to be so. He was the high priest of Sol Invictus, a pagan religion that worshipped the sun on Sunday! \\n\\nAnd people continue to follow that same decree for over 1,700 years now without even knowing why... Get it?
Why of course CHICAGO. We have hundreds of fancy resturants downtown located on the infamous Magnificent Mile ( Michigan Ave) with hundreds of stores and boutiques such as Eddie Bauer, A disney Store , Coach, Steve Madden and Stacy Adams, Tiffany's and Even a Victoria Secret( Vicky's Secret). We have many attractions such as Navy Pier, Art Institute, Millenium Park ( newest attraction), and a lot of other famous Attraction. Let's not forget the Sears Tower and Water Tower. So I strongly advise to visit Chicago

I've thought about this one for years.\\n\\nMy theory is that, for the most part, especially those outside of major cities, Americans don't have to worry about other countries. Who is on our border? Canada? They're Americans! Mexico? They just send over tons of illegals! (Note: I personally don't think those last two things.) \\n\\nThe rest of the world seems far away and not terribly relevant. And, to be honest, for most Americans that is probably fairly accurate. Unless a local factory is moved to South Korea, why would anyone be concerned about South Korea?\\n\\nThis contrasts with other countries which are constantly reminded of the rest of the world. Small countries - like say the Baltic States - in particular have very good reasons for wondering if their big neighbors will plow through them. Even major European countries - Germany, Poland, France - are constantly reminded of their neighbors on TV, radio etc.\\n\\nThis sometimes leads to silly reactions in the US like "France is a traitor." Well, even if you think French policies hurt the US, France is still a western democracy and in NATO (more or less). Sometimes it seems that people are equating France with the Soviet Union. Get some perspective people!\\n\\nBack to the media point, American TV shows and movies are major exports around the world. Everyone gets a chance to see us (to the extent that Desperate Housewives and Charlie's Angels represent us). But how often do foreign shows end up in the US? Sure the British will show up on PBS, but more likely foreign shows are Americanized - from Big Brother to the Office. They even tried an American version of Faulty Towers once! (Staring Bea Arthur, forget the name of the show, it stunk and was quickly canceled.)\\n\\nOn top of this is the American ideal that we are the beacon of democracy in the world. In many respects this has been a good thing (Marshall Plan) but in other more recent foreign policy adventures - which shall remain nameless - it hasn't worked out so well. I think this gives us a superiority complex. And the worst part about it is, we have a pretty darn good country over all (there are major issues) and so that opinion isn't ridicilous.\\n\\nSo, basically I think it is because we are a big country, relatively isolated by geography, we have a superiority complex, and that we export culture, so most Americans don't need to know - and so don't care too much - about the rest of the world.

In what regard? Many school districts define "gifted" children as those with an IQ above a certain level, such as 135. You can be a "gifted" artist, musician, or writer, meaning those things tend to come naturally to you. The same thing goes for sports or acting or anything, really.
I'm not sure how you've got your Firefox set up. It may be just the default settings we're dealing with here, or it might even be the result of a funky extension causing some issues. Either way, though, I'm going to tell you how I've got my browser set up to handle links that open in a new window (e.g. pop-ups). Of course it's first important to distinguish that these pop-ups you describe are the good pop-ups. I mean you probably still want Firefox to block the JavaScript pop-ups from showing. No problem, however, because my method won't bother those settings! So, deep breath. Here we go.\\n\\nFirst, read up on editing your user.js file at [1]. Next, download and place the following file from [2] in your profile folder. Make sure Firefox is closed when doing this. Now, open FF again.\\n\\nLastly, go to Tools -> Options and then select the Tabs panel. You should be able to see a setting that says "Force links that open new windows to open in:". Make sure the option is set to "a new tab" and you're reading to roll.\\n\\nSo, let us know how you get on. Good luck.

I am a teacher and had the same question. It has been proven that teenagers get the best sleep from 2 am - 10 am. But then why do we start school so early?\\n\\nMy principal answered this question simply. Because there are after-school sports and clubs which rely on daylight for their practices. That seems like a pretty logical answer to me. I don't want to get up early, but now at least I understand why.

There are two basic skills needed to create software.\\n\\n1) Knowledge of the platform and tools to develop and test the code\\n\\n2) Knowledge of the subject matter the application deals with.\\n\\nThis is true if you are writing an Accounting package on an IBM mainframe, a game for a PS2, or a utlity for MS Windows.\\n\\nIf we are talking high school, Geometry (specifically proofs) is a good yardstick to measure your ability to follow a process flow (1 above).  Also, most schools offer "Business Computer Programming" which is better for those wanting to write business applications (1 and 2 above), and "Computer Science" for those wanting to go the technical/scientific/mathemetical route.  In college, look in the Business Administration department if you want to write business apps (1 and 2 above), and check out Computer Science for other things (1 above).\\n\\nThe standard Sciences (Bioology, Physics, Chemistry, etc) are important in you are going to write applications in those areas (the part 2 above).  Also, if you want to write Engineering applications, get heavy into Physics and Math.
Exercise is a great way to get energy, especially cardio exercise.  I bought some dance tapes, I especially love DANCE Fat Burning Party by Crunch Videos.  Another thing that will help is MAKING yourself get up for a week, maybe two when the alarm does go off.  I used to be a snooze button hitter myself, and that much disturbed sleep is not sleep at all.  Also find a time to go to bed and stick to it, most people need between 6-9 hours of sleep a night, I have found the best to be 7-8, going towards 9 hours and people start to get too much sleep, which can make you just as tired as not enough sleep.  When you wake up in the morning especially when you start getting used to your schedule, splash your face a couple of times with cold water, and so come stretches over all your body.  Good luck! :)  And don't hit the snooze button any more.  :)  TRUST ME.

You've got some good suggestions so far (and some pretty crappy answers too).  \\n\\n1.  Make sure that there is a long round of foreplay.  The more excited and relaxed he is, the easier it will be.  \\n\\n2.  Use plenty of lube. Infact, I would say, that you cannot use too much lube.\\n\\n3.  Try (gently) opening up the area with something smaller than what you're currently using:  for example if you're trying to use your penis right now, start with a finger first.  It's smaller and will go in easier.  After awhile of that, he should be reader for bigger objects.\\n\\n4.  Make sure that you're relaxed also.  If he can sense that you're getting frustrated or impatient, that will carry over to him and make the experience difficult for you both, physically and emotionally.\\n\\n5.  Check into literature and instructional references about this. The only one I've ever heard of is "Bend Over Boyfriend," but I'm sure there are many others.  Look into this together, it will be a unifying activity and give him confidence and reassurance, which will translate into being more relaxed during sex. \\n\\n6. Make sure to make these experiences enjoyable, even if you don't reach your "goal" right away make sure that the experience is not a waste.\\n\\nHope this helps.  Have fun!\\n\\nFR

Hello, \\n\\nHere are some strong reason's you should consider upgrading to XP. \\n\\nStability. Windows XP has the ability to run a large number of apps without running out of resources, without crashing. (If you're running Windows 2000, you already have this, so there's no gain. \\nSecurity. This is a huge topic that I can't adequately cover in a few sentences suffice to say that security of your data and your privacy in Windows XP is leaps and bounds beyond anything available in Windows 9x. (Again, if you have Windows 2000, you already have most of the security capabilities of Windows XP.) \\nUI enhancements. A variety of changes in Start menu, taskbar, Windows Explorer, and Control Panel make everyday tasks such as launching programs, switching between windows, and managing files just a little bit faster, easier, and more convenient. These features can each be customized, so you can use the ones you like and change others back to Windows 9x/2000 style. (Similarly, you can banish the new look of Windows XP while still enjoying its other benefits.) \\nFast User Switching. Great for shared computers, FUS lets someone else log on without requiring you to first close all your documents and applications. \\nPower management. Standby and hibernation let me save power (on desktop PCs as well as portables) yet still have fast boot time, bringing me right back to where I left off. (That is, all the windows that I left open when the system powers down are already open when I power up.) \\nDigital photo support. I was never a fan of digital photography until I got XP because it was such a hassle before. But the support for cameras and scanners, as well as the features built in to Windows Explorer for viewing, printing, e-mailing, and manipulating images have actually made it fun and practical to work with photos in new ways. \\nRemote Assistance. The ability to actually see and work with someone else's screen while conversing with them through text, voice, and video chat is a killer feature for anyone who's looked upon as a computer guru and gets calls for support from relatives, friends, and neighbors. (I suspect that includes most PIBMUG members!) \\nRemote Desktop. The ability to connect with my home computer from the office (or vice versa) is awesome. It looks and acts exactly as if I'm at that computer five miles away, and I have access to all its files, printers, and other resources. And like remote assistance, it's acceptably fast if you have broadband Internet access. I also use it to work with other computers on my own LAN that's sometimes easier than hopping back and forth between two computers. \\nBetter help. It's easier to navigate, integrates information from the Microsoft Knowledge Base, and includes links to a number of diagnostic tools. \\n\\nPlease see here for more http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=why+upgrade+from+windows+2000+to+XP&prssweb=Search&ei=UTF-8&fr=FP-tab-web-t&fl=0&x=wrt \\n\\nhttp://www.windowsusers.org/whyupgrade.html

Unless the top 4 teams all choke badly in the next couple of weeks, I think #5 is the highest the ratings people are going to allow Gonzaga to go. That said, they *should* have a #2 seed in the tournament as long as they don't lose in the WCC tournament, but I can see the selection committee trying to shaft them again and give them a #3 seed because of "their schedule" and "weak conference."\\n\\nHonestly, I think I like the guess of the person who said "Elite 8," though I really, truly want to see them make the Final Four. Everyone looks at Adam Morrison, but J.P. Batista is averaging nearly a double-double (19+ points, 9+ rebounds) and Derek Raivio is a great free throw shooter. But Morrison will have to carry them through the latter games for them to go really far.
The only stability you can find nowadays in a career is to be the best and most flexible performer that makes the business successfull.  Keep your skills current, always keep learning, and be ready to roll if your position gets changed or cut.\\n\\nGood places for stability are things like utilities (water, power, phone), food service (waitress, cook), home repair (contractor, carpenter), and other things that people need all the time.

No, no, no. What you are referring to is social Darwinism or eugenics, where people believe in the superiority of one race, and that this superiority justifies cruelty to other groups. Eugenics is largely discredited today. Evolutionary psychology goes to great lengths to distance itself from eugenics. Try the wikipedia page below for more information.

Pastors get paid...They do a job for the church usually under contract. (That's why most get a house, and other stuff to boot. It's part of the pay.) So when they get old and don't want to Pastor anymore they retire...It doesn't mean they don't preach anymore it just means they don't get paid for it.\\n\\nThe rest you mentioned usually do those things just because they want to. They don't get paid and are volunteers. They have a calling and decide to serve their chuch by contributing what they can. And no they don't retire but some just quit when they don't want to do it anymore or when they find a replacement or when they die. So they, in a sense, do retire at some point in one way or another.
What is your question?  Have someone read along as you read?
Unfortunately, you have to buy a boost phone, and swap the SIM cards, in order to use the your old phone itself. Keep in mind that you still have to cancel your service w/ Nextel, and that the SIM card itself is what has all of your numbers stored on it for your phonebook. You need the boost sim card in your phone to make it prepaid.\\nP.s. Nextel can track the phone if you turn it back on after reporting it stolen. 400 dollar fee if you get caught!!
Depends on what you are trying to accomplish.  If quik meaningless relationships is what you want.  then trampy clothing usually is good.  but love is different, love happens on the whim.  Love is more like something you cant pinpoint.  My wife drives me crazy, and sometimes I havnt a clue why im in love with her.  then other times I dont even question it because its just there.  the presence of love Im refering too.  If a date is what your after, I would have to say confidance.  i love smart woman...so if they are smart...thats a plus.

Asthma attack:\\nSevere wheezing when breathing both in and out\\nCoughing that won't stop\\nVery rapid breathing\\nChest pain or pressure\\nTightened neck and chest muscles, called retractions\\nDifficulty talking\\nFeelings of anxiety or panic\\nPale, sweaty face\\nBlue lips or fingernails \\nRecognizing Asthma Triggers \\nAsthma triggers are everywhere in our environment: indoors, outdoors and in the very air we breathe. Identifying triggers, however, is not always simple. It usually involves a process of elimination. A good place to start is a consultation with your doctor. Ask for guidance. Your doctor may recommend a skin test for allergies.\\n\\nA vast range of triggers can set off symptoms of asthma. Chief culprits include dust mites, air conditioning (which cycles offending substances into the air we breathe) and cat dander. Individual asthmatics, however, tend to have their own "red-alert" triggers.\\n\\nCommon Allergic Asthma Triggers\\nThe following is a partial list of common asthma triggers:\\n\\nalcohol \\nair conditioning \\nanimal saliva and urine \\natmospheric ozone \\nbetel-nuts \\nbird, dog and cat dander \\nchemicals (e.g., hexachlorophene, formalin, ethylene diamine) \\ncockroaches \\ncold air \\ncolds and upper respiratory tract infections \\ndrugs (especially aspirin, cimetidine, antibiotics, beta blockers) \\ndust mites & their droppings \\nemotional upset \\nexertion (especially if strenuous and in cold air) \\nfood additives or preservatives (e.g., tartrazine, sulfur dioxide) \\nfungal spores \\nfumes (e.g., paint) \\ngastroesophageal reflux (GERD) \\ngum acacia \\nhair particle proteins \\nhigh humidity \\nkapok and feather fillers (e.g., in pillows and cushions) \\nmetals (e.g., cobalt, platinum, nickel) \\nnuts \\nplastics \\nPVC \\nragweed pollen (particularly in the U.S.) \\nrubber \\nsawdust (especially oak, boxwood and cedar wood dust) \\nshellfish \\nsmoke pollution \\nsolvents \\nstress \\nstrong odors \\ntemperature/humidity changes \\ntobacco \\ntree and grass pollens. \\n\\n\\nCommon cold:\\nThe symptoms of a common cold include sneezing, runny nose, nasal obstruction, sore or scratchy throat, cough, hoarseness, and mild general symptoms like headache, feverishness, chilliness, and not feeling well in general.\\nCold symptoms are due mainly to the body's response to the infection. When a nasal cell is infected by a cold virus, the body responds by activating parts of the immune system and some nervous system reflexes.\\nColds last on average for one week. Mild colds may last only 2 or 3 days while severe colds may last for up to 2 weeks.

Hiccups are gulping sounds caused by involuntary spasms of the diaphragm. The diaphragm is the muscle that separates the chest and abdomen and helps with breathing. Hiccups can be triggered if you eat too much or too fast, consume very hot or cold foods and beverages, or drink carbonated beverages. Other causes include cold showers, entering or leaving a hot or cold room, sudden excitement, and stress. \\nHiccups are not a serious medical condition and usually disappear on their own within a few minutes. If they last longer than 24 hours, hiccups may be a sign of another condition or injury. You should see your health care provider if you experience prolonged hiccuping. \\n\\nHome remedies are usually the primary treatment for hiccups, although no one is really sure how well they work. Hiccup home remedies include sneezing, being suddenly frightened, holding your breath, gargling, drinking pineapple juice, drinking water rapidly, sipping ice water, or swallowing dry granulated sugar. These activities may help by altering breathing patterns.
Vacuoles are membrane-bound sacs within the cytoplasm of a cell that function in several different ways. In mature plant cells, vacuoles tend to be very large and are extremely important in providing structural support, as well as serving functions such as storage, waste disposal, protection, and growth. Many plant cells have a large, single central vacuole that typically takes up most of the room in the cell (80 percent or more). Vacuoles in animal cells, however, tend to be much smaller, and are more commonly used to temporarily store materials or to transport substances.

Personal digital assistants (also called PDAs or palmtops) are handheld devices that were originally designed as personal organizers, but became much more versatile over the years. A basic PDA usually includes date book, address book, task list, memo pad, clock, and calculator software. Many PDAs can now access the Internet via Wi-Fi, cellular or Wide-Area Networks (WANs) or Bluetooth technology. One major advantage of using PDAs is their ability to synchronize data with a PC or home computer.\\n\\nThe term "personal digital assistant" was coined on January 7, 1992 by John Sculley at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Nevada, referring to the Apple Newton. Earlier devices like the Psion and Sharp Wizard have the functionality to be considered PDAs, however. In fact, PDAs by other names were available as early as the mid-1970s -- first as very advanced calculators, then as electronic organizers, and later as palmtops. [1].\\n\\nPDAs are some times refered to as "Palms" or "Palm Pilot" after an early PDA created by Palm, Inc. This usage is a case of genericized trademark, similar to refering to a tissue as a "Kleenex"; or a bandage as a "Band-Aid".\\n\\nThe currently major PDA operating systems are:\\n\\nPalm OS - owned by Palm, Inc. \\nWindows Mobile (Pocket PC), (based on the Windows CE kernel) - owned by Microsoft \\nBlackBerry - owned by Research In Motion \\nMany operating systems based on the Linux kernel - free (not owned by any company) These include: \\nGPE - Based on GTK+/X11 \\nOPIE/Qtopia - based on Qt/E Qtopia is developed by Trolltech, OPIE is a fork of Qtopia developed by volunteers \\nSymbian OS (formerly EPOC) owned by Ericsson, Panasonic, Nokia, Samsung, Siemens and Sony Ericsson \\nMany PDAs run using a variation of the ARM architecture (usually denoted by the Intel XScale trademark). This encompasses a class of RISC microprocessors that are widely used in mobile devices and embedded systems, and its design was influenced strongly by a popular 1970s/1980s CPU, the MOS Technology 6502.\\n\\nAccording to a Gartner market study, the overall market for PDAs grew by 20.7% in the third quarter (Q3) of 2005, compared to Q3 2004, with marketshare resolving as follows (by operating system):\\n\\nPalm OS for Palm, Inc. PDAs and some other licensees- 14.9% (declining) \\nWindows Mobile for PDAs that comply with the Microsoft's Pocket PC specifications - 49.2% (increasing) \\nBlackBerry OS for BlackBerry PDA (produced by Research In Motion) - 25.0% (increasing) \\nSymbian OS - 5.8% (increasing) \\n\\nPopular PDAs\\n \\nPalm IIIxe PDAPsion \\nApple Computer Newton \\nBlackBerry \\nhp iPAQ Pocket PC (Originally Compaq iPAQ until HP merged in 2002) \\nPalm Pilot, Tungsten, LifeDrive, Treo and Zire \\nSharp Wizard and Zaurus \\nSony CLIÉ \\nTapwave Zodiac \\nAlphaSmart Dana \\nDell Axim \\nGMate Yopy \\nFujitsu Siemens Loox 720 \\nList of PalmOS Devices \\nAbacus_PDA_Watch \\n\\nVarious operating systems based on the Linux kernel for various special designed PDAs (many other supported) - 0.7% (stable) \\nOther - 4.4% (stable) \\nThe reason usually cited for the resumption in PDA market growth (after market declines in 2002 - 2004) is the growing interest in PDAs offering wireless email capabilities (such as BlackBerries), and PDAs with built-in GPS capabilities for navigation. Smartphones — mobile phones with PDA-like abilities will likely curtail PDA growth in the near future, as smartphones are becoming very popular.
Yes, acctually the states that we know as California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah were all once a part of what was known as Northern Mexico.  However, due to a treaty signed on February 2, 1848, known as, The Treaty of Guadeloupe Hidalgo, the U.S. annexed the Northern half of Mexico to a tune of 15 million dollars.  This all came at the conclusion of the Mexican - American War, which started due to the Westward expansion of Americans and the Texas war for Independence.
This is a complex question with no one simple answer. But it general it comes down to boundaries. For some people, infidelity is a strong boundary that they will not tolerate being violated. It can also shatter trust beyond repair. But other people are willing to give their partner a chance to earn back their trust. Still others stay married for religious or financial reasons, and some have self-esteem issues and don't believe they are worthy of a partner who doesn't cheat on them. There are more possibilities, but these are a few of the common ones.\\nDr. Barb Nefer, www.bnlifeskills.com
In one year there are 365 days of 24 hours. Each hour has 60 minutes and each minute is 60 seconds long. So, 60s/min x 60min/hr x 24hr/day x 365days equals 31,536,000s. This many seconds is an even larger number than the number of miles light goes in one second! It would take you three years to get to number 31,536,000 if you could write one number per second for eight hours per day. This many miles means you could go back and forth across the United States over one thousand times! At 60 miles per hour it would take you 60 years! \\n\\nSo, we take these two very large numbers and multiply them together to see how many miles light can travel in one year. You can tell already that this is going to be huge! That number is 5,865,696,000,000. Working eight hours per day at a rate of one number per second it would take you two hundred thousand years to get to number 5,865,696,000,000! This gets you across the United States two billion times which at our average speed of 60 miles per hour, would take nine trillion years! \\n\\nNow that you know what the distance is that light travels in one year you can also know the distance between objects in the universe. The closest star to us is about four light years away. This means that it is 23,462,784,000,000 miles away. How about this: the edge of the universe is about 15 billion light years away from us! Can you even imagine how many miles away that is?

Apart from cover quality, paper quality, print size and layout may differ. Hardcover usually comes in stitched binding which is very durable compared to glued binding. Nowadays, there is an in-between stage called "trade paperback" which has larger print and somewhat better binding than mass market paperback, at usually 150-200% the price of mass market paperback.
This is when the supreme court ruled that "separate but equal" facilities were permissible under the constitution. The ruling held that segregation (for example, separate bathroom facilities etc. for "Colored" and "White" people) was allowed in the US.\\n\\nThis was overruled about 60 years later, though, by the Brown v. Board of Education decision. Here, they ruled that segregation in America would NOT be tolerated. For specific case details, search the Internet for "Plessy v Ferguson" or "Brown v Board of Education."

There's no set rule for picking a state capitol.\\n\\nMost capitols were set long ago, in a place central to a state.

Lansing is out capital.\\n\\nWhile Detroit is our biggest and most popular city, it wouldn't be practicle for a representative to ride from, say, Marquette.  \\n(This is actually a poor example because Detroit was the capital of Michigan before Lansing, but the point is the same.)

These words\\n            agree in the general sense of pain produced by\\n            untoward circumstances. Vexation is a feeling of\\n            disquietude or irritating uneasiness from numerous\\n            causes, such as losses, disappointments, etc.\\n            Mortification is a stronger word, and denotes that\\n            keen sense of pain which results from wounded pride or\\n            humiliating occurrences.

"Vexation arises chiefly from our\\n            wishes and views being crossed: mortification, from\\n            our self-importance being hurt; chagrin, from a\\n            mixture of the two."                    --Crabb.\\n            [1913 Webster]

God. (cheating) This explanation is what everyone eventually resorts to when the other answers fail. Now, before I go any further, I should make clear that I'm not talking about any of the gods defined in various religions. Throughout all of human history, we've been trying to explain existence. But nobody has ever succeeded. And it's likely that nobody ever will. So we create the concept of God, whose only necessary property is being "that which explains existence." \\n\\nThis doesn't tell us much about god, though. It doesn't mean that any particular religion is correct. It merely defines god as something which answers The Question, because we have not been able to.

I hope all people..children and adults as well.. can be warned that these predators are skilled at picking out just the right comments to gain trust with the sole purpose of finding a gullible victim. \\n\\nThere is software that can monitor/filter activity on computers. To me it is a responsibility of every parent/guardian to know who your children are talking to and what they are viewing online. These children may not talk to strangers on the street, but who are they talking to online in their bedrooms?

Well, I don't understand why denying that Islam has problems and should be corrected.  it drives me nuts when ppl say that those religious terrorists groups are not real muslims. then who is real and what is real? you should first cleanse Islam openly and honestly from all hatred rules toward others. say that the rules that violate laws should be thrown away, not the opposite.  it is interesting ppl say that those are not real Muslims while they say Saudi is best or Iranian is best and both they endorse or do nothing to hate.   clerics you hear them from time to time, saying that hate to the infidels and non-muslims is duty!!! and those who say anyone cooperate with christian and jews are traitors or infidels or whatever.
The man's son.
First of all, he was signed to a free-agent deal; he wasn't traded. Second, being a huge Cowboy fan, I think that signing him was a good idea. Andy Reid is too soft to handle players like Owens. Look at Keyshawn Johnson. When he left the NY Jets and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, he left on bad notes. When he came to the Cowboys, he uttered little word under the direction of the drill sergeant of the NFL, Bill Parcells. Parcells knows how to control outspoken players like Johnson and Owens. Just wait until football season starts.
There are so many "how's"  boy oh boy... One thing I can say is that you have to have patience.  You have to have it in your mind that you will work with it through the profitless times.  \\n\\nYou will need to have a "real" job in the mean time.  Because your bills will still keep coming even though your income won't. a huge percent of start up business lose money in the beginning. They say that the majority of them go under within the first 5 years.  If you can make it past that point you have a shot at keeping it going and actually haveing it be profitable.  I have my own business and It took about 2 (TWO) years before I got my FIRST order!!  I have now been in business for about 5 years and making money.  If I wanted to I could even have enough to do in order to hire employees.  But it took time.  \\n\\nThe second most important thing  - I must stress this - it is VERY important - YOU MUST HAVE SOMETHING THAT OTHERS WANT.   Wether it is a service or a product... if others don't want it you will NOT make a penny.  \\n\\nGood luck with it!!

Besides money, everyday math helps you plan for parties, select the right car parts and correctly double Aunt Jo's cookie recipe.  Some professionals use math to design iPods, Sirius radio, and the hybrid Honda Civic.  Other professionals use math to save the rain forest, create bionic eyes, and find new sources of energy.  Higher order math provide theories or guesses into the unknown such as the origin of the Universe or the existence of n-th Dimensions.  For me, math is mostly about money.
Yeah, I've noticed that too. Here's a disgusting thought. Just think if someone gathered up all those pubes and put em in a big pile. It would probably fill a freakin' stadium up. But, I digress on to why theres more. Dudes scratch themselves more, maybe scratchin those hairs loose. Also dudes stand up to pee so bam they fall right on the urinal. Alot of women shave so on average, less pubes. and since the ladies sit to do evertything if they are losing pubes there going right in the water. Well thats my two cents.

Well, it makes you real. I think we all want people on here to realize we are "real."

Questions like this are also serious enough to make us stop and think. That helps a great deal as well. We all need to approach every question realizing that no matter how odd it is, someone with a heart wrote it.

Send him a letter explaining how much you miss him.  Ask his forgiveness for any hurts he may have received, whether intended or not, or even known about.  The thing to remember is that people are very strange when they are stressed with family emergencies.  Also, he may be feeling guilty, or may be afraid of hearing "I told you so."  Under no circumstances should you bring up the past; let him discuss what he wants.  Additionally, if you do decide to meet with him, go alone.
A child support order is based on a number of factors, including the income and expenses of both parents and the percentage of time each parent has custody or visitation.  The amount of time that each parent spends with the child is already figured into the amount of support paid.  Therefore, payments will generally not be suspended during times when the child is with the non-custodial parent.\\n\\nSuppose for example, the non-custodial parent has the child 10% of the time.  That person will pay higher support than a non-custodial parent who has custody 40% of the time because there is a presumption that support will be provided during the time of custody.  The bigger the custodial burden, the biggest the monetary support will be.

Clearly, Sidious takes out Obi Wan (he's good...but not ready for the emperor was he). Anakin, certainly is no match for Yoda either and I think he would be to twisted for even Yoda to bring him back by now. \\n\\nSidious must now take on a new apprentice, but he still succeeds in creating the Empire, although weaker without the power of Vader to help him. Obi Wan isn't able to deliver Luke or watch over him, or influence him to join the rebellion. Yoda still has him transported to "his family" and after Owen and Veru are slain he joins the Academy to become a gifted pilot in the rebellion. \\n\\nHan is never employed by Ben to fly to Alderan, and Leia is executed by General Tarken as planned, prior to the rescue. \\n\\nR2D2's plans never make it to the rebellion and they are ultimately destroyed. Luke is captured by the Emperor once he realizes someone that strong in the force exists. Luke, without the influence of Ben and Yoda, is easily converted and trained in the Dark Side from scratch (probably killing off the interim apprentice). \\n\\nThe Sith rule for 1000 years.

That is why you should get a realator.  It might feel like you are paying a lot up front, but in the long run, you will save money.  To find out what you can afford take your rent and compare it to what you would pay for mortgage + taxes + repairs.  Now you have to look at the growth rate in your area and figure out how many years you are going to live there.  If you live there 10 years and the cost of your home doubles- then you made a lot of money, If the price is stagnant, then you lost money by paying taxes, paying for repairs and paying more $ than you would have rent.  The good news is you didn't have to ask anyone if your could paint the kitchen pink.

So color you nails in a way that makes you happy and you'll be making him happy.

I would guess that Pacifists or at least people who basically believe in the basic principles of Pacificism are in a majority in U.S. and even larger majority in the world. This includes most mainstream Christians. I can't find definite statistics. My personal experience tells me that most people prefer peace to war. Polls show that a growing majority oppose the war in Iraq.
No since the planet is not techtonically active.  But certain moons in are solar system are geologically active, such as Enceladus, a moon of Saturn.
The problems in Iraq will be solved when the oppressed people of Islam seek a reformation of their own religion, and they can't do that unless there is a champion to help protect them from abuses.  The U.S. is doing that.  Our troops will never come home unless we seriously change the nature of the U.S.  First, we have to become isolationist, and hope the rest of the world doesn't go into a dark age.  Second, we have to train out children to be cowardly and uncaring, so that protecting our own interests and the interests of freedom and democracy go unnoticed around the globe.  Third, we have to silence the people who speak out about the wrongs conducted at an astonishing rate in other countries, and simply listen more to the people who say it is all our fault.\\n\\nWe can never win this war.  It will never end.  The enemy will just change names, change religions, change ethnicities, change ideologies.  The enemy is ignorance encouraged by "it's not my problem" as an attitude.\\n\\nAnd we'll always be there to fight it.  You keep speaking up.  Free speech is part of it.  Don't let me silence you, or anyone else silence you.  Free speech may make a liar out of me yet and maybe the rest of the world will join us in letting freedom ring.
In mathematics, specifically in probability theory, and yet more specifically in the theory of stochastic processes, the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation is an identity relating the joint probability distributions of different sets of coordinates on a stochastic process.\\n\\nSuppose that { fi } is an indexed collection of random variables, that is, a stochastic process. Let\\n\\nPi1,...,in(f1 , ... ,fn)\\n\\nbe the joint probability density function of the values of the random variables f1 to fn. Then, the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation is\\n\\nPi1,...,in-1(f1 , ... ,fn-1) = ∫±∞Pi1,...,in(f1 , ... ,fn)dfn\\n\\nie a straightforward marginalization over the nuisance variable.\\n\\n(Note that we have not yet assumed anything about the temporal (or any other) ordering of the random variables -- the above equation applies equally to the marginalization of any of them).

That's a good question: This from the Orlando Sentinal-\\n\\nOn Sunday, the Australian government issued the following alert to its citizens: "We advise you to exercise a high degree of caution in the United Arab Emirates because of the high threat of terrorist attack. We continue to receive reports that terrorists are planning attacks against Western interests in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Commercial and public areas frequented by foreigners are possible terrorist targets."   \\nLINK\\nhttp://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/opinion/orl-thomas21_106feb21,0,2383510.story\\n\\nI am thinking yes.  \\nThe money used to fund the 9/11 attacks, most of it,  \\nwas sent to the hijackers through the UAE banking system. The UAE stonewalled U.S. efforts to track  \\nal Qaeda bank accounts after 9/11. In addition, the Emirates does not recognize Israel. And the UAE was a  \\ntransfer point for shipments of nuclear technology to Iran, North Korea and Libya. And if those aren't good  \\nenough reasons, I would just suggest I'm at a complete loss to offer what might be considered good reasons."  \\n      -- Lou Dobbs,  CNN

English has all kinds of unusual terms for groups of animals, & there's not any logic to it. One way you could think of it is that the name for the group isn't organized around taxonomy (the scientific categorization of species). We'd say a "flock of seagulls" or a "flock of sheep," but a group of crows is, believe it or not, a "murder of crows."\\n\\nThe same kind of thing with what we call young animals. Goats have kids & people have kids. Your example is just one that works the opposite way, when like things are differentiated rather than clumped together.

It is an aircraft with modified swivel wings that does not require the aircraft to have a long runway for take off. Instead it raises the turbine wings and rises in a vertical manner from where it was parked, when aloft the wings will readjust to an angle and thus the aircraft will be flown in a forward motion. It is usually used by the military for operations in areas withour adequate landing space.
This is kind of funny but I answered the same question for my female friend less then two days ago because she had the same issue, same problem! I researched it for her as a medic that likes to study gyn and here's your answer: The surge of hormones in your body causes your endometrium (lining of the uterus) to become extremely thick and then fissure and crack (so to speak) at your fourth week and then to fold and flush out of your body(menses). When you take the pill it enforces a state of pregnancy on the body and causes your endometrium to thicken and stay thickened so that you cannot become pregnant because your body already thinks that it is. So when your on it for three days or more esp. right after your period your endometrium starts to thicken again rapidly due to the surge of hormones the pill is providing, but then you suddenly come off and your body is like what the hec!?! I need to flush my lining again but it's not thick enough for a complete mense so it just releases the little that it's built up by infrequent spotting till the lining goes back to ex nhilo, or the beginning of a fresh cycle. So it's really nothing to worry about at all unless you starting cramping terribly and have spotting into the two week range. Then you should see your gyno. I hope I covered everything if I missed something post an additional detail and I'll do my best to answer it.

Nuclear medicine is a branch of medicine and medical imaging that uses unsealed radioactive substances in diagnosis and therapy. These substances consist of radionuclides, or pharmaceuticals that have been labelled with radionuclides (radiopharmaceuticals). In diagnosis, radioactive substances are administered to patients and the radiation emitted is measured. The majority of these diagnostic tests involve the formation of an image using a gamma camera. Imaging may also be referred to as radionuclide imaging or nuclear scintigraphy. Other diagnostic tests use probes to acquire measurements from parts of the body, or counters for the measurement of samples taken from the patient. In therapy, radionuclides are administered to treat disease or provide palliative pain relief. For example, administration of iodine-131 is often used for the treatment of thyrotoxicosis and thyroid cancer.\\n\\nNuclear medicine imaging tests differ from most other imaging modalities in that the tests primarily show the physiological function of the system being investigated as opposed to the anatomy. In some centres, the nuclear medicine images can be superimposed on images from modalities such as CT or MRI to highlight which part of the body the radiopharmaceutical is concentrated in. This practice is often referred to as image fusion.\\n\\nNuclear medicine diagnostic tests are usually provided by a dedicated department within a hospital and may include facilities for the preparation of radiopharmaceuticals. The specific name of a department can vary from hospital to hospital, with the most common names being the nuclear medicine department and the radioisotope department.\\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_medicine

I was in a long distance relationship at one point. We talked online, and on the phone all the time. Occasionally, we visited each other. Finally, he moved to my town to find a job but he could so I moved and left all my family back to his town. I was 18 at the time and he was 19. We got married and soon after I became pregnant. Before my son was born we moved back to my town thank goodness. Now, I have to tell you that we did not get to know each other good enough. We have a lot of problems to this day. Our lifestyles were so different. We've been married a little over a year now but have many problems. Just beware and get to know the person well before making any commitments.

Traditionally the amphibians are taken to include all tetrapods that are not amniotes. Recent amphibians all belong to a single subgroup of these, called the Lissamphibia. Recently there has been a tendency to restrict the class Amphibia to the Lissamphibia, i.e. to exclude tetrapods that are not more closely related to modern forms than they are to modern reptiles, birds, and mammals.\\n\\nThere are two ancient, extinct, subclasses:\\n\\nSubclass Labyrinthodontia (paraphyletic) \\nSubclass Lepospondyli \\nOf the remaining modern subclass Lissamphibia there are three orders:\\n\\nOrder Anura (frogs and toads) (in Superorder Salientia): 5,228 species \\nOrder Caudata or Urodela (salamanders): 552 species \\nOrder Gymnophiona or Apoda (caecilians): 171 species \\nAuthorities disagree on whether Salientia is a Superorder that includes the order Anura, or whether Anura is a sub-order of the order Salientia. In effect Salientia includes all the Anura plus a single Triassic proto-frog species, Triadobatrachus massinoti. Practical considerations seem to favour using the former arrangement now.
I don't know the monkey, but of course it wont make a good pet. You are trying to domestic a wild animal - a process that takes generations and rush it into one.

A Swiss clockmaker in the employ of the Duke of Hesse-Kassel, first conceived of logarithms. The method of natural logarithms was first propounded in 1614, in a book entitled Mirifici Logarithmorum Canonis Descriptio, by John Napier (c. 1550 - 1618; Latinized Neperus), Baron of Merchiston in Scotland, four years after the publication of his memorable invention. This method contributed to the advance of science, and especially of astronomy, by making some difficult calculations possible. Prior to the advent of calculators and computers, it was constantly used in surveying, navigation, and other branches of practical mathematics. It supplanted the more involved prosthaphaeresis, which relied on trigonometric identities, as a quick method of computing products. Besides their usefulness in computation, logarithms also fill an important place in the higher theoretical mathematics.\\n\\nAt first, Napier called logarithms "artificial numbers" and antilogarithms "natural numbers". Later, Napier formed the word logarithm, a portmanteau, to mean a number that indicates a ratio: λoγoς (logos) meaning ratio, and αριθμoς (arithmos) meaning number. Napier chose that because the difference of two logarithms determines the ratio of the numbers for which they stand, so that an arithmetic series of logarithms corresponds to a geometric series of numbers. The term antilogarithm was introduced in the 1800s and, while convenient, its use was never widespread.
It's used for estimating fuel costs.\\n\\nEach town has an average number of heating degree days for the winter and average number of cooling degree days for the summer.\\n\\nWith those averages, you can calculate how long the air conditioner or heater will run for the year and then calculate the fuel costs.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou can calculate it from the average temperature each day.\\n\\nExample:\\nAverage temperature for Jan. 1 is 30°F.\\n65°F - 30°F = 35°F\\n\\nJan 1 is one day, so 35° difference * 1 day = 35 heating degree days\\n\\n\\nAverage temperature for Jan. 2 is 35°F.\\n65°F - 35°F = 30°F\\n\\nJan 2 is one day, so 30° difference * 1 day = 30 heating degree days\\n\\nYou do this for every of the year and add it up.\\n\\nJan 1 = 35 heating degree days\\nJan 2 = 30 heating degree days\\nJan 3 = \\nJan 4 = \\n\\nAdd it all up and you get the number of heating degree days for the winter.

A returning boomerang is a propeller. Though it is not a requirement that the boomerang be in its traditional shape, it is usually flat. A falling boomerang starts spinning and most then fall in a spiral. When the boomerang is thrown with high spin, the wings produce lift. Larger boomerangs are used in hunting, thus they drop on the ground after striking the target. Smaller ones are use in sport, and are the only boomerangs that return to the thrower. No one would think a spinning object flies a straight line, neither does the boomerang, it flies a turn or to be clearly: It flies on a circle. So it naturally returns to its starting point unless all spin is eaten up. Now in more detail:\\n\\nReturning boomerangs consist of two or more arms or wings, connected at an angle. Each wing is shaped as an airfoil, air travels faster over one surface of an airfoil than the other, as it follows the longer path, thus creating lift, along what is roughly a plane which intersects the airfoil at a near right angle along the long axis of the wing.\\n\\nThese wings are set so that the lift created by each wing opposes the lift of the other, but at an angle such that the flight pattern is constantly shifted as the forces of lift, drag, speed, rotational inertia etc. 'attempt' to reach equilibrium, see Boomerang engineer.\\n\\nThis is what makes the boomerang 'return gracefully to the hurler, fluttering to a stop in his hand'... when thrown correctly. This is also what makes the boomerang 'rocket straight up into the air before plunging to its shattered doom'... when thrown incorrectly. With the exception of long-distance boomerangs, they should not be thrown sidearm or like a frisbee, but rather almost vertically.\\n\\nFast Catch boomerangs usually have three symmetrical wings (in the planform view), whereas a Long Distance boomerang is most often shaped very similar to a question mark. Maximum Time Aloft boomerangs have one wing considerably longer than the other. This feature, along with carefully executed bends and twists in the wings, help to set up an 'auto-rotation' effect to maximize the boomerang's hover-time in descending from its highest point in the flight.\\n\\nProminent boomerang designer/builders include Bob Burwell and Tony Butz from Australia, Rusty Harding from the USA, Jerri Leu from Brazil and others.\\n\\nFollow the link for more information.\\n\\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boomerang#Design

final drive for a 2000 is 4.4:1....this is on the type R heres some info\\n\\nSo how do we make a car that has a motor putting out such weak torque faster? That's when gears come in. Gears will multiply the torque by certain factors depending on their size/teeth count. Take a GS-R in first gear (3.23), when the motor spins 3.23 times, the driveshaft will turn once. And for every 4.4 turns of the driveshaft, the differential (final drive, 4.4) will turn once. That is directly connected to the axles which turn the wheels. You can simply multiply 3.23*4.4 to get an absolute gear ratio of 14.212:1. This means for every 14.212 turns of the motor the wheels will turn once. So if the motor gets to turn 14.212 times in order to only turn the wheels once, the amount of torque the motor is applying to the wheels gets multiplied that many times.\\n\\nif you were also asking for the 91 i dont have that info

It's easier than you might think.  Windows has a built in sound recorder that will do the job.  You do need to get an adapter that will convert the audio output from your tape deck (RCA style plugs) to a 1/8" stereo jack.  you should be able to go to Radio Shack and get this for a few dollars.  You then directly connect the audio out on your tape deck or stereo to the line in jack on the back of your computer.  Open Windows sound recorder.  Push play on your tape deck and record on you computer.  If you want to break up the tracks, you'll need to stop the tape and the recorder between songs.  I think an easier way is to record it as one big file.  Then use a sound editing program like Sony Sound Forge to chop it up.  Also note that the Windows sound recorder save audio as a *.wav file which is very large compared with *.mp3.  You'll want to have plenty of hard drive space available if you do many of these tapes.  A good sound editing program should be able to do the conversion for you.\\n\\nGood luck\\n\\nJason
Since China is a communist country and doesn't practice democracy, freedoms are very limited. The government doesn't want the Chinese people to have unlimited information to the rest of the world. If they do, then the people will realize how little freedom they have compared to the US. Also by banning sites, China is banning opportunities for demonstrations/uprisings, which could lead to violence. That could lead to international attention and would cause China to lose face.

I think it is because people have a lot of hang ups about sex in the US.  So many people directly associate sex with love and assume you have to be in love with someone to have good sex with them.  Personally, I think that sex is one of the most fun things a person can do and I'm sure most people agree.  I also think that it is very personal and I'm not into sleeping with just anyone.  But I think that sex between 2 (or more) people that get along and have a good time together but are not in love, is perfectly fine.  I also think that it is a natural desire for most people to be want to have sex with more than just the one person you are in love with, especially people who are comfortable with sex.  My boyfriend and I have tried swinging with other couples and we have enjoyed it.  We both trust each other and know that it is just about having fun.  Plus, I feel more confident that my boyfriend isn't going to cheat on me because he has an outlet for his natural feelings to be with other women.  Just my opinion!
I think we are just wired that way - if humans were the kind of species to lie back and smell the roses, we probably would still life in caves and hunt with stone spears. \\nIf we do well and get something, we are happy only for a while. So if we want that happy feeling again, we obviously have to go out and try to get something else again to re-capture that feeling. Also, as we are successful and acquire something, we usually get admired (and envied) by the people around us, a rather pleasant feeling. This admiration by others probably is expressed in all kind of pro-creative ways, therefore making it likely that this trait will get passed on. \\nSo it would seem that we have the whole weight of evolution weighing in against us when it comes to contendedness.
Nothing wrong with it. That's a deal!

You need to establish for what purpose they are learning English. There are threee main areas to language; speaking, & listening, reading then writing.  It takes longer for non native speakers to sound native once they reach around age 12, on the other hand the true second languge learner (one who already reads, write and composes in correct gramatical form in their native language) will be able to comprehend and produce more content area language than younger learners.  Younger than 12 year olds will sound more like native English speakers at an amazing rate but may have little to no idea what they are saying. If your Spanish speaker already is a literate Spanish language learner there will be alot of transfer (translation & relation) to their native language.  The easiest thing to do is find out what they know alot about that you also know alot about (perhaps the Bible, Hollywood movies, music) and do lessons/conversations around this topic.  Provide as much illustrations and props as possible.  Good luck from a second language learner & teacher=:

His office is legally responsible for doing an in-depth security review of all major company sales by foreign businesses.  They review the deals to ensure there are no legal or security concerns before the deal is allowed to go through.  If they run into any concerns they can take steps to mitigate the risks (such as ensuring no one will be placed into sensitive areas, background checks, rescoping the contract, etc...)  This is naturally done in private since we are talking about security concerns and big business deals that can affect the stock of said companies.\\n\\nIt is possible that his staff reviewed the deal and gave the go-ahead without his direct involvement and he is merely saying he trusts his staff: heck, he did pick a bunch of people who think exactly like him.

basically you want to take out everything that is common to all terms(basically a factor common to each term)\\n\\nthere is a multiple of 5 in each term and a y in each term, so you pull those out and divide all of the terms by 5y\\n\\nso \\n\\n5y(8y2 - y^3 +3x)\\n\\nhope this helps!!
This depends mainly on which state you are . Usually the more immigrants like Texas, California , Florida could take 7 to 15 months. Other states with few cases could be shorter. If you've got the labor permit I believe you are more than halfway in the process, once you start the i485 ( not sure if the correct number) you are done , just a matter of wait. The more  important document you need in this stage is the travel document or travel parole that is only valid for one year and take slike two months to renew so you need to apply every 10 months. with thia paper you are free to move outside of the US and comeback. You do not need a visa anymore just wait until your residence card is ready.
Don't worry, your in there. There's too much going on around you that leaves no room for "yourself". Get away-be completly alone and away from anyone you know, for about a day or two. You'll become "you" again, in no time, but THEN you have decisions to make about how your not going to let that happen to you again! Time for some changes! Good Luck...
UNP looks like a great stock. Its 1,2,and 5 year charts look great. It can never hurt to take some profits if you are debating on selling or not. Sell half if you like to cash in but also have some shares left if te stock goes higher.\\n\\nHere is Investors Business Daily's take on UNP:\\nIBD Stock Checkup Analysis:\\nUnion Pacific Corp receives an overall rating of A-, which is in the 92nd percentile of all stocks in the Investor's Business Daily database. The overall rating is calculated using five proprietary ratings that measure each stock's Technical and Fundamental qualities and the Technical and Fundamental qualities of the industry group that it resides in, as well as a rating on the stock's current price attractiveness.\\n\\nUnion Pacific Corp receives a Technical Rating of 96, which places it 2nd out of 13 stocks in the Transportation-Rail group.\\n\\nUnion Pacific Corp receives a Fundamental Rating of 48, which places it 11th out of 13 stocks in the Transportation-Rail group.\\n\\nUnion Pacific Corp receives an Attractiveness Rating of 98, placing it 2nd out of 13 stocks in its group.\\n\\nThe Transportation-Rail group's technical rating of A- ranks it in the 90th percentile of the 197 different Investor's Business Daily Industry Groups. The Transportation-Rail group's fundamental rating is C-, ranking it in the 55th percentile of all groups.
take 10% of that number, divide it by your number of competitors and that should give you your worse estimate of what you can expect. of course if you have no competition, that number will be significantly higher.\\n\\nno competition= 540 potential customers\\n5 competitors= 108 customers\\n\\nnow say these people exercise twice a week at say 3$ per day admission, you'd be looking at a daily income of :\\n\\n3$ x 2times a week X 108 people= 648$ a week X4 weeks= 2592$ a month in gross income.\\n\\nif you have the maximum 10% of the people, you can take this amount 2592 X 5= 12960$ a month\\n\\nso your best case scenario would bring it 540 customers (10% of the population with no competition) that would spend 12960$ a month at your place only for working out. of course if you sell other products you can expand your profit margin\\n\\nyour worse case scenario would be 2% of the population with 5 competitors 108 people that would spend 2592$ a month.\\n\\ni must point out that starting a gym is a very risky business and quite hard to succeed. 90% of new gyms dont make it through a year and go bankruptcity. I have seen tons of gyms go under, but i believe that if you truly have a good marketing plan and have agressive prices and publicity that you would prevail.\\n\\ngood luck
Eclipses of the sun and moon usually happen six months apart and then in a fortnightly patten when they do. As an example, there will be a penumbral lunar eclipse on March 14th 2006 and about a fortnight later there will be a solar eclipse on March 29th, similarily on September 7th 2006 there is a partial eclipse of the moon followed by a solar eclipse on September 22nd 2006.

Anna Eleanor Roosevelt \\n\\nA shy, awkward child, starved for recognition and love, Eleanor Roosevelt grew into a woman with great sensitivity to the underprivileged of all creeds, races, and nations. Her constant work to improve their lot made her one of the most loved--and for some years one of the most revered--women of her generation. \\n\\nShe was born in New York City on October 11, 1884, daughter of lovely Anna Hall and Elliott Roosevelt, younger brother of Theodore. When her mother died in 1892, the children went to live with Grandmother Hall; her adored father died only two years later. Attending a distinguished school in England gave her, at 15, her first chance to develop self-confidence among other girls. \\n\\n \\nTall, slender, graceful of figure but apprehensive at the thought of being a wallflower, she returned for a debut that she dreaded. In her circle of friends was a distant cousin, handsome young Franklin Delano Roosevelt. They became engaged in 1903 and were married in 1905, with her uncle the President giving the bride away. Within eleven years Eleanor bore six children; one son died in infancy. "I suppose I was fitting pretty well into the pattern of a fairly conventional, quiet, young society matron," she wrote later in her autobiography. \\n\\nIn Albany, where Franklin served in the state Senate from 1910 to 1913, Eleanor started her long career as political helpmate. She gained a knowledge of Washington and its ways while he served as Assistant Secretary of the Navy. When he was stricken with poliomyelitis in 1921, she tended him devotedly. She became active in the women's division of the State Democratic Committee to keep his interest in politics alive. From his successful campaign for governor in 1928 to the day of his death, she dedicated her life to his purposes. She became eyes and ears for him, a trusted and tireless reporter. \\n\\nWhen Mrs. Roosevelt came to the White House in 1933, she understood social conditions better than any of her predecessors and she transformed the role of First Lady accordingly. She never shirked official entertaining; she greeted thousands with charming friendliness. She also broke precedent to hold press conferences, travel to all parts of the country, give lectures and radio broadcasts, and express her opinions candidly in a daily syndicated newspaper column, "My Day." \\n\\nThis made her a tempting target for political enemies but her integrity, her graciousness, and her sincerity of purpose endeared her personally to many--from heads of state to servicemen she visited abroad during World War II. As she had written wistfully at 14: "...no matter how plain a woman may be if truth & loyalty are stamped upon her face all will be attracted to her...." \\n\\nAfter the President's death in 1945 she returned to a cottage at his Hyde Park estate; she told reporters: "the story is over." Within a year, however, she began her service as American spokesman in the United Nations. She continued a vigorous career until her strength began to wane in 1962. She died in New York City that November, and was buried at Hyde Park beside her husband.

Your internet service provider would normally give you that info, providing you have an email address from them, but its normally "pop.<service provider>.com" and "smtp.<service provider>.com" where <service provider> is the actual name of your service provider.  Some providers also make it easy and have both servers as a generic "mail.<service provider>.com".  But if you're not into trial and error, just contact them.

Well, they go through sexual reproduction, and like the last guy said, they go into a mating ball.  However, its not always many males with females...that depends on the species. Sometimes its just one male and one female.  The male inserts his hemipene into the anal opening of the female and finding the vagina, releases sperm.

Rappers don't get paid jack.  If they can't cover more than what they can for the help, they get little to nothing.  That's just because 85% of those guys have little to no common sense, think ebonics is a primary language, and probably are just dropouts.  In life and school.  Prime example: 50 Cent was a hoodlum before he became a rapper.  Thing is, he's a great businessman so props to that jigga.

People naturally sleep better in a cold room or when the body becomes suddenly cold. This is due to part of your circadian rhythm. In addition to sleep naturally being effected by light (your internal clock, the superchiasmatic nucleus, is located near the optic chiasm where the optic nerves cross); most humans will wake easier by the light of the sun and sleep easier in the dark, there is also sleep regulation based on body temperature. \\n\\nThe human core body temperature changes slightly throughout a day. At around 3 AM the body temperature is at its lowest. It starts to rise until near noon when it plateus and even dips a little bit (this results in people getting tired around lunch time...not because of the lunch itself, after all, you don't get tired after eating breakfast or dinner). Many populations, such as Mexico, take into account this normal fatigue and allow workers to nap (siesta) around that time. Afternoon the body starts rising in temperature again until around 8 PM when it begins to fall again overnight.
Because they are Liberals first, before they are Jewish!\\n\\nBy this i mean that their values are not Jewish values. Just because a person is a Jew, it does not mean that the values they hold are Jewish values, values that are congruent with the values of Judaism! And so they operate their lives as a Liberal, rather than as a Jew.
Faith, as it is found in Christianity, is a cop out to really trying to understand the nature of the universe.  In Buddhism, the monks tell you not to take anything without evidence.  Why?  Because they are seeking the truth.  And, you do not find the truth by following things without evidence.  Spirituality, is developed when you discover a little more about the nature of our relationship to the infinite.
HUMAN.  We all live, breath, eat, crap, talk, and bleed similarly.  In most instances, we don't think alike which makes us individuals.  Don't look at the color of one's skin or their "race", look at their personality and into their heart.

The story of enzymes is as fascinating in its details as it is amazing in its applications in promoting human health and wellbeing. Enzymes are proteins that are an integral part of Nature. In fact, life without enzymes would not be possible. Enzymes are needed for each and every chemical reaction that make life possible. No vitamin, mineral or hormone can exert its beneficial effects in the human body without the involvement of enzymes. Despite their central role in all bodily functions, it is only now that the full import of enzymes in human health and disease has begun to be fully appreciated. MUCOS Pharma, the pioneer in systemic enzyme therapy, has been the standard bearer for the last fifty years in having paved the way to elucidate the function of enzymes, and their use as an oral systemic therapy.\\n\\nFunctions of Enzymes\\n\\nSince they have unique structure, each enzyme is meant to carry out a specific task. Any given enzyme is evolved to fulfill a definite function, and this specificity allows the body to strictly control the use of enzymes. Once activated, an enzyme will perform its specific function until it is "exhausted," or it is inhibited by another enzyme, in which case its activity is curtailed and/or stopped. As researchers have found out after years of painstaking and laborious work, there is a good reason for this control: It prevents bodily processes from spinning out of control, which may be deleterious to health and wellbeing.\\n\\nEven casually, the specificity of enzymes suggests that there will be particular types. In fact, Nature has "engineered" families of enzymes for specific tasks. One of the most beneficial and abundant classes of enzymes is referred to as proteolytic enzymes. Enzymes in this category have the ability to "nibble" at other proteins, and break them down into smaller chains of amino acids. Hence the name, proteolytic enzymes, which literally means "chewing up proteins."\\n\\nOn the surface, it might appear counterintuitive to degrade proteins in the body. Are proteins not required for optimal cellular function, and do they not afford good health and vibrancy well into the golden years? Indeed, they do! In disease, however, the human body produces proteins that could potentially have injurious effects, and further compromise health if left unattended. It was precisely this goal that Drs. Max Wolf and Helen Benitez set themselves roughly one-half a century ago when they started their quest to find a wholesome, effective and safe alternative for human health and wellbeing. Of course, their objective was to understand how c comes about and whether natural alternatives could be designed that will not wreak havoc on the human body as radiation and chemotherapy do. Despite their scientific astuteness, little did Drs. Wolf and Benitez anticipate that their systemic enzymes will afford man immense health benefits, irrespective of whether or not systemic enzymes "cured" c.\\n\\nDrs. Wolf and Benitez, along with Dr. Karl Ransberger, a young biomedical researcher from Germany, tested a large number of enzymes from animal and plant sources. The work was slow, and it progressed in fits and starts, since the researchers had to optimize the conditions to isolate and purify the enzymes. Not only that, they had to struggle to maintain the activity of the enzymes, because the enzymes are notorious for being finicky and unstable. That is, if the enzymes are not handled properly under precisely defined condition, they become inactive. After all, the researchers were working in the 1950s, a time when the basic enzyme technology was still in its infancy, and individual scientists had to rely more on their wits than technology to tweak answers from Nature.\\n\\nOnce Drs. Wolf and Benitez had optimized the conditions necessary to maintain the enzyme activity, they started the next part of their work to combine and evaluate various enzyme formulations in assessing th

Adjust wireless antenna height, placement, alignment.   Try moving it all over.\\n\\nConfigure the wireless part of the router to use a different channel.  Perhaps the default channel is already being used in your area or is just really noisy.  There are channels 1-11 to choose from.  (Again this is on your wireless router configuration)  If it is on 1, change it to 6 or 11.  If it is on 11 change it to 1 or 5.   If it is on 4-6 try either 1 or 11 and see which ones are better signal.\\n\\nKeep in mind that the signal strength isn't the only measurement...make sure it doesn't drop the signal.  An okay signal that is stable is better than a great signal that drops out from time to time (which can happen)\\n\\nWhen "tuning" your antenna position, keep in mind that walls might have metal in them that causes interference too.  Try to provide "line of sight" when ever possible between wireless devices.  Glass is fine.  Maybe putting your antenna closer to the window if you are trying to get the signal somewhere else in the house... or putting it closer to a hallway so there is less physical material between the two places.
A black hole is a concentration of mass great enough that the force of gravity prevents anything from escaping it except through quantum tunneling behavior (known as Hawking Radiation). The gravitational field is so strong that the escape velocity near it exceeds the speed of light. This implies that nothing, not even light, can escape its gravity, hence the word "black". The term "black hole" is widespread, even though it does not refer to a hole in the usual sense, but rather a region of space from which nothing can return.

Another way is to temporarily divert the whole river through a side channel or tunnel, but I think this is usually done only when they want to build a dam across it.\\n\\n3. They can put a temporary barrier across a part of the river to build the foundations there, then build another temporary barrier across a different part of the river to build the next foundations, and so on till all the foundations are build.  \\n\\n4. Some rivers flow seasonally, so they just wait till it is not flowing to build the bridge.

Where did such a funny unit of purity come from? It turns out that a German gold coin called a mark was common about a thousand years ago. It weighed 24 carats (4.8 grams). The purity of the gold in the coin was expressed in the number of carats of gold present in this 24-carat coin.

Not EVERY day, but I do lie a lot.  It's just one of those things that people do...from when someone asks you "How are you today?" to "Was the food good?".  I think it's ok to lies to spare someone's feelings, even though the Bible says otherwise.
The issue of Iran is a complicated one.\\n\\nOh, to answer the nationality question, I'm an American. But I'm also a political scientist, so I look at this a bit differently.\\n\\nIran's nuclear enrichment program is really a diversion. You have to understand that Iran, along with Iraq and North Korea, were labeled members of an "axis of evil." Now, the United States invaded Iraq. And the Iranians know that the United States could overrun North Korea in about six weeks. Add to that the fact that we have troops in Pakistan and Afghanistan, as well as Turkey, and what do you have?\\n\\nA surrounded and very nervous Iran.\\n\\nThey see that as soon as North Korea starts tossing around nuclear weaponry as a potential, the United States quickly backed off any sort of war footing and started talking negotiation. In reality, nuclear weapons (or the perception therein) give the Iranian government a big bargaining chip.\\n\\nPlus, the United States is much less likely to invade Iran if they have a suspicion that the minute they step over the boarder, New York vanishes in a cloud of radioactive dust.\\n\\nAs for nuclear experiements, I'm assuming you mean testing a bomb. They won't, at least if they're smart. THhey'll give the impression that they have one, maybe even parade one down main street of Theran. But to test one would make it clear that they have a nuclear weapon, and that makes them a target.\\n\\nMy biggest fear about Iran having a weapon of mass destruction is not that the Iranian government would use it. Indeed, they have no system for delivering it, even to Israel. What the fear is for me is that they will lose the bomb - that is, some scientist who feels like the West screwed him might give one to a terrorist.\\n\\nIn reality, the fewer nuclear weapons on the planet, the safer we all are.

Crude oil is formed from accumulations of small organisms, mostly phytoplankton and zooplanton that are buried in sediments in both marine and lacustrine (fresh water) environments. Other organic material is mixed in such as spores, pollen, woody material, and other material such as fecal pellets from marine organisms. These materials often settle through the water into an organic-rich mud that is very low in oxygen (anaerobic) so there are few organisms to feed on the material  and it accumulates over long periods of time. Rivers contribute to this process by both delivering large quantities of organic matter, and also large amounts of sediment to bury this organic matter. \\n\\nOver time these clay-rich sediments are buried under thousands of feet of sediments, dewatered by pressure from the overlying sediment and become shale. As the shale is buried its temperature increases due to geothermal warming. When it reaches temperatures and pressures of 140 degrees F. (60 C) it begins to convert to oil. As temperature increases from continuing burial processes it reachs a temperature where it begins to form natural gas. Both the oil and the gas are gradually expelled from the shale. Typically shales are found in depostional settings where they may be interbedded with sandstones. Sandstones will have higher porosity (more and bigger holes) than shale and the oil and gas will displace salt water that is remaining in the sandstones. Eventually the oil and gas migrates upward through the water and if the overlying structure has formed some sort of a trapping configuration, (like a sandstone overlain by an impervious shale, or a fault that has created a seal against the sandstone, then this becomes an oil reservoir. \\n\\nA very similar process occurs in carbonate rocks, like limestone and dolomite, except the organic material originates within the carbonate rock in many instances. If the carbonate reef (for example) has been buried by an impervious layer of shale or carbonate mud of a sabkha, it  will become an oil reservoir.  In other instances, the source of the oil will be a shale that is below the carbonate rocks, and the oil will migrate upward into this reservoir.

Well, firstly, that's very illegal, and you probably shouldn't do it. But I won't stop you. And I doubt you will be able to find a website where you can download the full version of Windows 2000. But you could always try downloading a p2p software, such as limewire, and then downloading it from there. And then after you download it, DON'T open it. Scan it for viruses first, and then if its clean, burn it to a disk, and you should be set.

Do you mean Upton Sinclair?\\n\\nUpton Sinclair, Writer  \\n\\n    * Born: 20 September 1878\\n    * Birthplace: Baltimore, Maryland\\n    * Died: 25 November 1968\\n    * Best Known As: Socialist author of 1906's The Jungle\\n\\nUpton Beall Sinclair was a prolific American writer known for his affiliation with socialism and famous for his 1906 novel, The Jungle. Sinclair was born in Baltimore, but his family moved to New York when he was a child. When he was a teenager he began writing brief bits for newspapers and magazines. The Jungle was his sixth novel, and its success made him nationally famous. An exposé of the Chicago meatpacking industry, the book helped change national regulations on food preparation and earned him enough money to establish the Helicon Home Colony, a socialist community in New Jersey. Although the community only lasted about a year (it burned down in 1907), Sinclair remained committed to social causes and to exposing the dangerous effects of capitalism in realistic fiction, essays and various other writings. In 1915 he moved to California, where he ran unsuccessfully for public office several times, including running for governor as a Democrat in 1934. In the 1940s Sinclair again had popular success with the "Lanny Budd" series of novels, beginning with World's End (1940) and including the Pulitzer Prize-winning Dragon's Teeth (1942). In 1953 Sinclair moved to Arizona, where he continued to write books, including working his 1932 autobiography, American Outpost, into The Autobiography of Upton Sinclair (1962).\\n\\nHe is not related to Canadian broadcaster Gordon Sinclair.\\n\\nFOUR GOOD LINKS\\n\\n    * Upton Sinclair\\n      Good general summary of his career\\n    * The California EPIC Movement, 1934\\n      Historical pieces about Sinclair's bid for governor\\n    * Upton Sinclair\\n      Letters from Jack London and the text of The Jungle\\n    * Upton Sinclair\\n      Hyperlinked biographical essay
My thoughts on that are to push your own confort zone. Do things that you never thaught you'd do, even If you think you won't be good at it. Just have fun with it. Weather it's buying art supplies, and making an awful picture, getting sand paper and sanding down an old piece of furniture and restaining it, doing a public social event if your not very social,Ect. If you start feeling silly about it, or questioning why your doing it, Just remember that its your comfort zone speaking.

People with Down's syndrome probably do not all look alike to those who know them personally. There are, however, physical characteristics that they have in common. Down's syndrome is a genetic disorder that was established at the moment of conception. Normally, there are 23 pairs of chromosomes that make up the fertilized egg. One of each pair is from the sperm and the other from the egg. In Down's there is an extra chromosome 21. The medical term is trisomy 21. This is the usual reason for Down's syndrome. \\n\\nThe most obvious consequenses of having an extra chromosome 21 are an epicanthal fold around the eyes, short stature, dental deformaties, broad chest (that's why they seem to look alike) and mental retardation. The epicanthal fold about the eyes give them an Asiatic or Mongoloian appearance, hence, the older term mongoloid. \\n\\nAs in any group of people, those with Down's exhibit different personalities and varied abilities.

Because that is what life is about! Keeping us on our toes....keeping us alert......presenting challenge after challenge so that we never become stagnated and always strive to improve......to grow. If life were predictable, wouldn't we all be so bored. If we knew what was around each corner would we not turn around and go back? Sure.....we get to piss and moan about "Why didn't someone tell me this could happen???" But deep down inside, the pride from overcoming the obstacle outweighs the obstacle.Great question. :)
Typing in all caps is the online equivalent to yelling, and therefore bad manners. All caps are also harder to read. Here's why...\\n\\nOnce we have mastered reading (not sounding out words letter by letter), we recognize words by their shape rather than by the order of the letters. Think about it...you read whole words, not individual letters. When words are typed in all caps, they lose their shape -- that is, they become rectangular. The reader has to revert to reading them one letter at a time, hence slowing them down.\\n\\nGraphics designers use this as a tool to draw attention by slowing down a reader. It is an effective tool when used properly.
Bone consists of a chemical mixture of inorganic salts (65 to 70 per cent) and various organic substances (30 to 35 per cent) and is both hard and elastic. Its hardness is derived from inorganic constituents, principally calcium phosphate and calcium carbonate, with small amounts of fluorides, sulphates, and chlorides; its elasticity is derived from such organic substances as gelatin, collagen, and traces of elastin, cellular material, and fats. Internal tubular structures called Haversian canals contain nerve tissues and blood vessels that provide bones with organic nourishment. Surrounding these canals is a somewhat porous tissue composed of thin plates, known as lamellae, and usually containing cavities filled with a network of connective tissue called marrow or myeloid tissue. Bone marrow accounts for from 2 to 5 per cent of the body weight of a person and consists of tissue of two types. Yellow bone marrow is made up principally of fat, and red bone marrow is tissue in which red and white blood cells and blood platelets originate. The external portions of bones, enclosing all the components mentioned above, include the compact and hardest of all bone tissue, which is in turn generally sheathed by a vascular, fibrous membrane known as the periosteum.

I do agree in one aspect however I do also find many questions to answer that seem to just make my day complete. I have found many new contacts here and really in the long run just enjoying it all.\\n\\nI do find a couple of your answers good advice. That is just ignore what you don't want to see and look only at what you want, smile, then meet the challange with some of your knowledge and ability passed on to another. In that way you have truly contributed to this whole package and done your part to increase the unanswered questions making it hard for me to choose where to go next. Ha Ha Ha I kinda feel I am needed and my work never ends as I lay down at night with peace and really looking forward for the new day to hurry and get here cause I have plenty of new questions to answer ha ha.\\n\\nYes my friend I do at times have to shake my head at some questions then BINGO A GREAT ONE APPEARS AND I FORGOT ALL ABOUT THE ONES I WANT TO IGNORE. So I then smile and start typing a new answer like I am doing now with the thought the world is only turning because of me ha ha ha\\n\\nThat is just a joke OK so do take it like that. I sure hope you are smiling.\\n\\nIf you want some deep spiritual questions just stay tuned ha ha. I will soon start to asking questions that no one can answer ha ha. You just wait and see. Oh yes it will get stupid answers but I tell you I am sure no one will be right ha ha\\n\\nDo you think you know the Bible? then tell me with an absolute positive answer that no one, no not one can cause you to change your opinion in the future in regards to it. I am serious not joking.\\n\\nWhat color was Mr Adam's hair in the garden of Eden? Absolutely the bible tells all its precise color and length. Do you know it and this is no joke.

If you are talking SHORT TERM, this two-week-long weight loss program will work. It has worked for me, for Renee Zellweger (after her Bridgett Jones movies) and for many others who need fast weight loss. Follow these steps religiously:\\n\\n1.Drink lots of fresh water every day using this formula: (your current weight) divided by 2 = ounces of water to consume each day. I like to drink room temperature water from a bottle because it’s easier to “chug.” I put four of the bottles on the kitchen counter and make sure they are all empty by the end of the day. Best to consume them throughout the day.\\n\\n2.Don’t drink any alcohol of caffeine. No soft drinks. Only green teas. REMEMBER, THIS IS ONLY 14 DAYS. YOU CAN DO IT IF YOU REALLY WANT YOUR GOAL.\\n\\n3.Fast walk or run for at least 60 minutes each day. It’s best to exercise in the morning since it will rev up your metabolism and keep our calorie-burn rate high throughout the day. You can do this by walking in place, using a treadmill, or walking outside. Whatever works for you.\\n\\n4.Do at least 50 crunches each day. I break mine into 2 or 3 different sessions. Also, if I need to do 20 crunches, I play a little trick with my mind and I “pretend” I am going to count to 25. It’s amazing how this helps the body get to all of the crunches with the same intensity.\\n\\n5.Eat only fresh vegetables! This is the key to the whole thing. Eat as many as you want, but DON’T eat any of the following: starchy vegetables including potatoes, squashes, pumpkins, and the like. They will work against you. Limit carrots, snow peas, and other veggies that are high in sugar content. NO GRAINS. Just fresh vegetables. You can eat salads, stir-fries, steamed, etc. But this is at the heart of your success.\\n\\n6.Don’t eat anything after 7:00 p.m.\\n\\n7.Put photographs (from magazines) up all over your house of trim, fit women. They will serve as motivators.\\n\\n8.Several times each day – especially when you first get up and when you go to bed, say something like: “I am enjoying my weight of (your goal weight).” Put it in the present tense and say it many times – with feeling! This will affect your subconscious mind to help you achieve your goal. Also, post these words in the same places where you post the photographs.\\n\\nAlso, don’t be surprised if you start feeling better than you have felt in a long time. You will have more energy, most aches and pains will be gone, and your whole body will look brighter. One warning, early on your elimination will be a little “urgent.” You may have some cramping. But this will all go away soon. Your body is in a deep cleanse.

And pretty soon WWE will destroy TNA, cuz honestly TNA tried to invade WWE at the 2005 royal rumble commercial, and instead of TNA beatin up WWE, it was WWE beatin the h*** out of TNA. SO right now TNA are afraid of WWE. WWE Rulez!!!

A natural monopoly is one that exists because of economies of scale rather than one created by a government to fill the need.\\n\\nTelephone companies, cable companies, et cetera are often local monopolies give sole license to operate within a city because the cost of deploying cables or wires to the home would be cost prohibitive for multiple companies to deploy, own and operated.\\n\\nMicrosoft is like a natural monopoly, despite some of their practices that some deemed anti-competitive, they have had competitors for decades.  For reasons of compatibility, operability, and cost, Microsoft became, for all intents and purposes, a monopoly because the consumers chose them by the product purchases they made.  Consumers were always free to buy an Apple computer, DR-DOS, WordPerfect, and any of countless other products.  However, they didn't because there was an economy of scale by being able to exchange Word and Excel documents, buy a computer from competing manufacturers which ran the same software, and purchase software written for Windows becuase it was too costly for the developers to write software for multiple platforms.  Thus it was "natural" rather than being given sole license by any particular governing body such as the US Government.\\n\\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_monopoly

Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres

There is a rectangle, 6x8 inside of a larger rectangle.  The distance between the inner and outer is "x", and we're assuming it's uniform all the way around.\\n\\nSo the 6ft side of the rectangle has x on the left and x on the right, so the total side is 6 + 2x.  The 8ft side has x on top and x on bottom, or 8 + 2x total.\\n\\nArea is length * width, and you know total area, border and all, is 100.\\n\\n100 = (6+2x)(8+2x)\\n\\n100 = 48 + 28x + 4x^2 <--- you can divide through by 4 here\\n\\n25 = 12 + 7x + x^2; make the equation = 0 by subtracting 25 from both sides, and reorder a bit:\\n\\n0 = x^2 + 7x - 13\\n\\nNow use quadratic formula to solve for x; when ax^2 + bx + c = 0; x = [-b +/- sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)]/2a\\n\\nso for x^2 + 7x - 13 = 0 a is 1; b is 7; and c is -13\\n\\nx = [-7 +/- sqrt(7^2 - (4)(1)(-13)]/2*1 \\n\\n= [-7 +/- sqrt(49 + 52)]/2\\n\\n= [-7 +/- sqrt(101)]/2 <-- you would only consider the plus, since -7 minus sqrt101 would give you a negative number, thus your answer\\n\\nx = [-7 + sqrt(101)]/2 = approx. 1.52 ft

Scolopendra gigantea, commonly identified to as ‘Peruvian giant yellowleg centipede’ or ‘Amazonian giant centipede’, is the world's largest representative of scolopendras which can reach lengths of up to 26 cm. The species inhabits the North and West regions of South America and the islands of Trinidad and Jamaica. It feeds on lizards, frogs and birds. The body consists of 21-23 segments which is ‘coppery red’ or maroon in color and comprises of up to 23 pairs of yellow-tinted legs (with one pair per body segment); the legs are adapted for fast walking (even running) and for holding tight the prey before poisoning and killing it.\\n\\nThe centipede has modified claws which curve around its head and can deliver venom into its prey to help the immobilization of it. The venom is toxic to humans (the poison contains acetylocholine, histamine, and serotonin) and causes a local sharp pain (similar to a hornet-sting), and severe swelling, chills, fever (up to 39º), weakness.\\n\\nS. gigantea is a popular pet among arthropod fanatics – however the centipede should not be handled without protective equipment given that even a trace of the venom coming in contact with skin can cause a reaction. The condition of having been poisoned by the venom of a centipede in the genus Scolopendra is called scolopendrism.\\n\\nFemale S. gigantea centipedes exhibit parental care, guarding and tending their nests of eggs. Juveniles are very dark red or black in color, and very thin with large spherical red heads. They molt several times before reaching adult size.\\n\\nRetrieved from "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scolopendra_gigantea"

I don't know why he asked such a silly question.\\nSome people here have a feeling that they are real know-alls and there are others who are just too serious about life. The know-alls must understand that it was by mere chance that they were able to experience or read or learn about a certain fact while others were not so fortunate.

Technically, children born in the U.S. whose parents are not citizens of the U.S. are not automatically U.S. Citizens (contrary to popular myth).  That being said, even if the child is a U.S. citizen the parents do not automatically become U.S. citizens.  They must go through the naturalization process like every other citizen-to-be must.\\n\\nThe 17th Amendment deals with the popular election of Senators, not U.S. Citizenship.  The 14th Amendmendment deals with citizenship, the due process of law, and the election of Representatives.\\n\\nI stand partially corrected, however.  There is currently an ongoing debate whether or not children of illegal immigrants born in the U.S. are automatically citizens.  Since the parents have not vowed to relinquished their loyalty to their home country they are not "subject to the jurisdiction thereof" of the U.S.  This will likely be heatedly debated for the next few years until the illegal immigration problem in this country is worked out.\\n\\nRegardless, the Canadian parents still need to go through the naturalization process...they cannot "automatically" become citizens.

First let me say that I'm so sorry for the turmoil that is inside you. Love has no age, it's in the heart. However, you have children to consider. It's difficult to step back from a situation that consumes you. You have to ask yourself this question -- are you in love with this young woman, or are you swept away by the attention, devotion, respect, sex, etc. that you may be receiving from her? Does this young woman truly love you, or are you a wise, older, father figure for her? In ten years, will she have outgrown you and look for a younger man? Will you be hurt? She doesn't share the same wisdom and life experiences that you have. She has her entire life ahead of her. I'm not trying to negate your feelings, just am trying to tell you to look at it from all views. Another thing, show your wife the respect she deserves. She's the mother of your children and deserves your respect for that alone. Would she consider counseling? Is there anything left to salvage? Is there resentment or other issues that is the reason for the lack of sex? I would suggest that you slow down, do some serious evaluating of your own life, and perhaps seek counseling for yourself. Is your self-esteem shot? Please don't do anything rash, but if you both decide that you are truly in love for the long haul -- even when you're 74 and she's 43 -- I wish you happiness. Good luck with whatever you decide.

Ocean currents have a tempering effect on the climate of Boston, MA. In other words, the ocean is warmer than the land in the winter, and colder than the land in the summer. This has the effect of making both the summer and the winter more mild than they are more inland, although the effect is not as strong as on the west coast of the US, because the prevailing winds blow from west to east in the US.\\n\\nAlso, because the ocean currents hitting Boston, MA are coming from the Carribbean Ocean, hurricaines occasionally make their way to MA.

Because water is polar.  Polar molecules can create favorable interations (hydrogen bonds) where + and - charges match up, for an energetically favorable configuration.  Lipids (fats and oils) are non-polar, and do not forma favorable interactions with water and other polar solvents.  Hence, they keep to their own--polar and polar go well together, and nonpolar goes with nonpolar.  Hence, hydrophobic (water fearing) and lipophilic (fat loving) mean the same thing.

Network of networks.  At the lowest level are the actual "neurons" - implemented in models - which form an interconnected decision-making matrix.  It's more a reflection of logic connections than specifying physical components.  It's not a network of computers or processors.  It is a network of neurons.  These neurons (the net) may indeed be spread out over the network or amongst CPUs or servers or workstations, but that's merely an implementation description, not how they work.

Get a sheet of paper and list things that you would like to do and acomplish them (start out simple). Take some time to do something nice for someone. It feels good. List your good qualities- I'm sure you have many. Most people tend to look at what they don't like about themselves and ignore the wonderful qualities that make them THEM! I think the older a person gets the easier it is. If your in certain age groups no one has good self esteem, even those who seem to have it. Some people who are popular and seek attention and friends have the worst self asteem and waste so much energy trying to prove themselves. If there are some qualities that you don't like, change them. If your self esteem is based on looks alone (don't know what you look like) accentuate the positive about yourself!
There are some BBW who are happy with who they are. Others are not.  But you may not be able to do anything yourself to make them change from not being happy to being happy.\\n\\nI did have one BBW girlfriend in high school who was happy with herself, but it got too serious and, in high school, it just shouldn't be that serious.\\n\\nAs for those who are not happy with their weight, it's like the old light bulb joke: how many psychiatrists does it take to change -- one, but the bulb has to want to change.\\n\\nI think some people like to define themselves by what is wrong with themselves rather by what is right with themselves.  They get comfortable in their "misery" (I'm too fat, I'm too thin, my hair's straight, it's curly, I can't do this, I don't deserve that, ...)\\n\\nFrankly, I like women who are voluptuous rather than  not.  Always have.\\n\\nPoint is that they just have to wake up and smell the coffee and realize what they have in you as a friend or lover.  But, from experience, I don't think there's much you can do to convince them otherwise.  In one relationship, I had to have one foot out the door before they got a clue.\\n\\nIn some cases, I've known people in relationships with BBW where the woman used her weight as a way of controlling the relationship and limiting the intimacy in the relationship.  And these guys loved these women so much that they couldn't or wouldn't leave.  Why loved these women but, well, to be frank, I don't think these women loved their husbands as much as the husbands loved them.\\n\\nSo, maybe the thing is not to try and change the women that you meet to make them happy but instead determine if you can live with them as happy (or unhappy) as they are.  It is possible that people can change, but they have to want to change.  And sometimes the only thing that can jolt someone into change is to not to support their habits, but to let them know that you love them but there obsessing is to the point where you aren't sure they're happy being with you and that it is time to move on for your own sake.  It's not a threat, you have to respect yourself and your needs and happiness and they need to respect themselves and you.  Otherwise it can just be a co-dependent mess.

Don't worry about your voice it will get deeper later on. I think the best thing you can do to court a girl is to give her flowers. A single red (or if you know her favorite color then use that) rose makes quite a statement. Have you told her you like her? Don't stress about it just be yourself and take it slow. Ask her out and when you pick her up have some flowers ready. If she likes stuffed animals you can give her little stuffed animals after you've had a couple of dates. It's really not hard. Don't buy her really expensive things untill you get very serious. Be polite and respectful and complement her on the things she wears and even her perfume if she wears any. After you get serious you can send flowers to her work or her school. Girls like public displays of affection. I hope that helps hun, and if it doesn't than there are plenty of other girls that will love it!

Hey you cannot really argue against material gifts (i.e. flowers, chocolate, electronics, special clothing items, jewelry, watches, movie, dinner, etc.) – especially personalized stuff.    If you can afford it, give her as many as you can.   But remember the basic rule:  It’s usually better to give one really cool/classy gift than 2 or 3 “cheap” ones.   However, to stand out, make a real impression and go above and beyond the crowd you MUST give her an emotionally romantic gift too.    I leave it up to you to think what would be more appropriate in this case; after all, no one knows her as well as you do.    But if you want my opinion, I would suggest you hold her hands close to your heart, look deep into her pretty eyes and just say something to the effect like:  “I AM NUTS ABOUT YOU”.    A word of caution:  If you don’t really feel it do NOT say it (unless of course you are a darn good actor!)    By the way, I’m specifically using the word “NUTS” here since, at your still tender age of 17, saying phrases like I LOVE YOU in the above context might just come across as a bit too strong, intimidating and/or pretentious.
The very first thing to do would be to controll the people that claim to represent Islam. As long as any group is perceived to be violent, racist, and criminal because of the people that represent it, other people will continue to see it that way. You can't burn down a man's house, and rape his daughter, kidnap his wife and torture his son on T.V. and expect people to understand your "good side" Your religion as a whole needs to excomunicate the criminal faction, and refuse to allow them to call themselves followers of the true islam. Seperate yourselves from hatred and violence! That is the only way to swing public opinion to your side.
It depends on what exactly you are looking for. I don't know of many places in the city that are cheap (I have found some good deals at Lombaridi's on Polk, but not cheap), but if you have a car or can borrow one go to Tri-City at 40900 Grimmer Blvd in Fremont. There I have found some of the best deals on all types of new gear; clothing, skis and snowboards. The later you go in the season, the cheaper things get (of course).\\n\\nIf you do not mind buying used or surplus gear, try the Wilderness Exchange in Berkeley (1407 San Pablo Ave), the store is great. I have found some good deals there on winter clothing and camping gear.

Well, I'll try to be clear. Yes, it's semen (and only it!)\\nThat event is called male orgasm and it occurs when the excitment reaches the apex.

They are not.The large seeded Virginia Group peanuts are grown in Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and parts of Georgia.\\nThe major producers/exporters of peanuts are the United States, Argentina, Sudan, Senegal, and Brazil.It is also illegal under Federal Law to grow peanuts on more than one acre (4,000 m²) of land for commercial consumption. This effectively creates a peanut monopoly, as it is not economically feasible to grow peanuts on only one acre (4,000 m²) of land, while drastically increasing prices.

Make sure the enclosure and the drive type match.
if you invest in the stock market try having a very broad portfolio. have stocks from large cap(5 bil and up) mid cap (1-5 bil) and small cap(under 1 bil). also dont get all stocks from one market like compuer reasearch try to have a variety of companys in case one industry fails or does poorly(aircraft). If your really bad get a broker to handle your money. you will not get money instantly. that is how you lose money. hold on to stocks for 5-10 years and it will payoff you will not get rich overnight. mabey try investing in mutual funds. where a group of people pool their money and buy lots of companys so even if some companys fail you still make money. im 17 and invested 5000 in a mutual fund and in one year I have 7000. with a 10 year projected value of 25000. so dont jump to decisions and reasearch a company enough so in 1 min you could explain to a 5 year old why you are investing in that company. look at companys competetors.

Proof by contradiction\\nSuppose sqrt(7) is rational. Then it can be expressed and a fraction in reduced form, that is the numerator and denominator have no common factors.\\n\\nsqrt(7) = m/n.\\n\\nThus  7 = (m/n)^2 = m^2/n^2\\n\\n7n^2 = m^2\\n\\nSince 7 divides both sides, 7 has to divide m^2, so 7 must be of the form m = 7k for some integer k.\\n\\n7n^2 = (7k)^2 so we can factor a 7 out of both sides\\n\\nn^2 = 7 k^2. We repeat the arguement, now n has to be divisible by 7 so n = 7q for some integer q.\\n\\nso n = 7q, m = 7k, that says m and k both have 7 as a common factor a contradiction since m/n was a reduced fraction.\\n\\nThere for the assumptin that sqrt(7) is rational must be false.

Jules Mazarin, born Giulio Raimondo Mazzarino (July 14, 1602, Pescina, Italy – March 9, 1661, Vincennes, France) served as the chief minister of France from 1642, until his death. Mazarin succeeded his mentor, Cardinal Richelieu.\\n\\nBiography\\nMazarin's early military and diplomatic experience, which marked him as a friend of France in the contests between French and Spanish factions in papal politics, recommended him to Richelieu. As papal vice-legate at Avignon (1632), and nuncio extraordinary in France (1634), Mazarin was perceived as an extension of Richelieu's policy, and under Habsburg pressure, Mazarin was dismissed by Urban VIII, January 17, 1636. Mazarin immediately went to Paris, offered his services to Richelieu and was naturalized as a French citizen by April. The apex of his diplomatic services was the secret treaty between France and Tomasso of Savoy signed late in 1640. The following year, at Richelieu's insistence, Mazarin made cardinal.\\n\\nAs Louis XIII died in 1643, and Louis XIV was only a child — Mazarin functioned essentially as the ruler of France: although the 5-year-old Louis XIV became king in 1643, under the regency of queen mother Anne of Austria, and until his death in 1661, Mazarin directed French policy. His modest manner contrasted with the imperious Richelieu, and Anne was so fond of him and so intimate in her manner with him, that long-standing rumors that they had been secretly married and that the Dauphin was their offspring.\\n\\nA fictionalized Mazarin is a major character in Alexandre Dumas' novel, Twenty Years After. In it, Mazarin is portrayed as power-hungry, paranoid, and greedy.\\n\\n[edit]\\nMazarin's policies for France\\nMazarin continued Richelieu's anti-Habsburg policy and laid the foundation for Louis XIV's expansionism. The victories of Condé and Turenne brought the French party to the bargaining table at the conclusion of the Thirty Years War with the Treaty of Munster and Treaty of Osnabrück (Treaty of Westphalia), in which Mazarin's policies were French rather than Catholic and brought Alsace (though not Strasbourg) to France; he settled Protestant princes in secularized bishoprics and abbacies in reward for their political opposition to Austria. In 1658 he formed the League of the Rhine, which was designed to check the House of Austria in central Germany. In 1659 he made peace with Habsburg Spain in the Peace of the Pyrenees, which added to French territory Roussillon and Cerdagne in the far south and part of the Low Countries.\\n\\nTowards Protestantism at home, Mazarin pursued a policy of promises and calculated delay to defuse the armed insurrection of the Ardèche (1653) for example, and keep the Huguenots disarmed: for six years they believed themselves to be on the eve of recovering the protections of the Edict of Nantes: in the end they obtained nothing.\\n\\nTowards the pontificate of the successful Spanish candidate, Cardinal Pamphili, elected pope (15 September, 1644) as Innocent X, there was constant friction. Mazarin protected the Barberini cardinals, nephews of the late pope, and the Bull against them was voted by the Parliament of Paris "null and abusive"; France made a show of preparing to take Avignon by force, and Innocent backed down. Mazarin was more consistently an enemy of Jansenism, more for its political implications than out of theology, and on his deathbed warned young Louis "not to tolerate the Jansenist sect, not even their name."\\n\\nControversy over the Cardinal's policies, and the weakness of the regency, resulted in two civil wars, known as la Fronde (1648-52). Twice, in 1651 and 1652, he was driven out of the country, by the Parliamentary Fronde and the Fronde of the Nobles. The countless abusive and satirical pamphlets called Mazarinades published against him often invoked his Italian birth. In addition, the increasing authoritarian royal power of France (a process begun under Richelieu), as

commodity \\nThe word commodity is a term with distinct meanings in business and in Marxian political economy. For the former, it is a largely homogenous product, whereas for the latter, it refers generically to wares offered for exchange.\\n\\nLinguistically, the word commodity came into use in English in the 15th century, being derived from the French word "commodité" meaning "benefit, profit", similar in meaning to biens (goods). The Latin root meaning is commoditas, referring variously to the appropriate measure of something; a fitting state, time or condition; a good quality; efficaciousness or propriety; and advantage, or benefit. The German equivalent is die Ware, i.e. wares or goods offered for sale.

Too many variables to consider, it's impossible to answer in this forum.  First of all, what do you mean by "nuclear bomb."  There are crude nuclear devices, which is called "dirty bomb."  A dirty bomb is basically a normal bomb with whole bunch of radioactive waste.  The explosion will send the particles into  the air, making SOME people die and thousands sick.  Also, decontainmenation would be a nightmare and public panic.  A small bomb could also be a tactical nuclear device.  Those are the so called "suitcase" bombs developed during the cold war.  They are, for the most part, not very effective.  Consider that it's very heavy and easy to detect by our current sensors in major cities.  If your definition of small is something like a "small" nuclear missile from states like.... say Iran/North Korea, then 25 mile radius will pretty much be wasted.  That being said, it's hard to denote a nuclear weapon by terrorist in NYC.  For starters, the Dept of Homeland Security has nuclear sensors around critical infrastuctures.  Nuclear signatures are VERY easy to detect, esp crude devices that could be used by a terrorist. There are tons of resources for this.  But it might be too difficult to explain to high school students.\\n\\nI don't know what the person below me is saying.  First, people in direct vincity of Nagasaki, all 120,000 of them, were VAPORIZED immediately. Second, WWII era nuclear weapons are like nothing of what we have now.  A single cold war era multi warhead ICBM missile could destory ALL life in the U.S East Coast.  A typical U.S. MIRV has ten sepearte warheads.  Don't think of this as ten different Nagaskais because EACH of those warheads are HUNDREDS of times more powerful than the "fatman" dropped on Japan.  A single U.S Trident U.S. submarine could destory a whole nation.

Early methods of transferring or distributing risk were practiced by Babylonian traders as long ago as the 2nd millennium BCE. The Babylonians developed a system which was recorded in the famous Code of Hammurabi, c. 1750 BC and practiced by early Mediterranean sailing merchants. If a merchant received a loan to fund his shipment, he would pay the lender an additional sum in exchange for the lender's guarantee to cancel the loan should the shipment be stolen.\\n\\nA thousand years later, the inhabitants of Rhodes invented the concept of the 'general average'. Merchants whose goods were being shipped together would pay proportionally divided premium which would be used to reimburse any merchant whose goods were jettisoned during storm or sinkage.\\n\\nThe Greeks and Romans introduced the origins of health and life insurance c. 600 AD when they organized guilds called "benevolent societies" which acted to care for the families and funeral expenses of members upon death. Guilds in the Middle Ages served a similar purpose. The Talmud deals with several aspects of insuring goods.\\n\\nInsurance became far more sophisticated in post-Renaissance Europe, and specialized varieties developed.\\n\\nToward the end of the seventeenth century, the growing importance of London as a centre for trade led to rising demand for marine insurance. In the late 1680s, Mr Edward Lloyd opened a coffee house which became a popular haunt of ship owners, merchants and ships’ captains, and thereby a reliable source of the latest shipping news. It became the meeting place for parties wishing to insure cargoes and ships, and those willing to underwrite such ventures. Today, Lloyds of London remains the leading market for marine and other specialist types of insurance, but it works rather differently to the more familiar kinds of insurance. (See Lloyd's of London).\\n\\nInsurance as we know it today can be traced to the Great Fire of London, which in 1666 devoured 13,200 houses. In the aftermath of this disaster Nicholas Barbon opened an office to insure buildings. In 1680 he established England's first fire insurance company, "The Fire Office", to insure brick and frame homes.\\n\\nThe first insurance company in the United States provided fire insurance and was formed in Charles Town (modern-day Charleston), South Carolina, in 1732.\\n\\nBenjamin Franklin helped to popularize and make standard the practice of insurance, particularly against fire in the form of perpetual insurance. In 1752, he founded the Philadelphia Contributionship for the Insurance of Houses from Loss by Fire. Franklin's company was the first to make contributions toward fire prevention. Not only did his company warn against certain fire hazards, it refused to insure certain buildings where the risk of fire was too great, such as all wooden houses.\\n\\nIn the United States, regulation of the insurance industry is highly Balkanized, with primary responsibility assumed by individual State insurance departments. Whereas insurance markets have become centralized nationally and internationally, State insurance commissioners operate individually, though at times in concert through a national insurance commissioner's organization. In recent years, some have called for a federal regulatory system for insurance similar to that of the banking industry.\\n\\nIn the State of New York, which has unique laws in keeping with its stature as a global business center, attorney general Eliot Spitzer has been in a unique position to grapple with major national insurance brokerages. Spitzer alleged that Marsh & McLennan steered business to insurance carriers based on the amount of contingent commissions that could be extracted from carriers, rather than basing decisions on whether carriers had the best deals for clients. Several of the largest commercial insurance brokerages have since stopped accepting contingent commissions and have adopted new business models.
Probably the set-up where we went bowling, he got drunk yet talked about how well he could hold his alcohol, told me stories about how he'd been busted for drugs in the past and was on probation and that his wife wouldn't let him see his sons without supervision.   Then he ran out of money and asked if he could borrow some to buy some more drinks....\\n\\nThat same night while in the bowling alley, I ran into my boss - embarrassed as I was to be seen with this guy, it was not near as embarrassing for him, because he was there on a date too - but not with his wife!!\\n\\n\\nLOL

Ok, without getting a full history beyond "I sleep 10+ hours a day", there may or may not be a health issue here. Although the "appropriate" amount of sleep is widely accepted to be an AVERAGE of about 8 hours; there are clearly individual differences among people in what their sleep "need" is.\\n\\nBeyond the individual differences, there are also age related need... babies will sleep much of the day, where as the elderly will need a bit less than the average adult. Children and teens will need a bit more than the average adult (although teens will often not get it due to poor sleep habits).\\n\\nNow, all that being said, you may indeed have a sleep disorder with 10+ hours of sleep. That is quite a bit for someone who typed at least 3 sentences with proper grammer and syntax. There are some non-respiratory (the most common sleep disorder is Obstructive Sleep Apnea) that can cause people to sleep all the time and teen years is when they tend to show up. Narcolepsy and Klein Levens comes to mind, but they are rather rare, and the cataplexy (sudden loss of muscle tone resulting in collapse) that is associated with narcolepsy isn't something that is easily overlooked. \\n\\nIf you find that you snore when you sleep, then obstructive sleep apnea is a possibility; indicating that you may be breathing poorly (or not at all) through the night disrupting your sleep and requiring you to stay in bed tring to catch up longer. When apneics wake up hundreds of times a night to breath, they don't actually remember it generally.\\n\\nAdditionally, poor sleep hygeine can add to the amount of sleep you end up trying to get. If you have a poor sleep schedule (changing get up and go to bed times often), work out close to bedtime, drink caffeine late, have TV or radio on at bedtime, read in bed, etc... then you may not be getting very good sleep, and therefore needing more sleep.\\n\\nNOW, with all those possiblilities thrown out, there are still more I haven't mentioned. The best thing to do is seek out a sleep disorders center in your area (they are everywhere) and get a referal from your primary care physician and have a sleep study done to determine if indeed you have a problem that may be a health risk to you. These are easy tests really, you will come into a lab before bed, they will attach a couple dozen wires to you with a little glue and you'll sleep overnight while being monitored, if narcolepsy is suspected then you may do some "nap studies" through the day also. When its all done, a sleep specialist will review the results with you determining if you do or do not have a sleep disorder. \\n\\nGood Luck

The Census does not ask about religion, because it is prohibited by law, so there is no information on so detailed a level. However, the Statistical Abstract of the United States has a table of populations that self-report as Jewish in each state. The latest data says 620,000 in Florida. Assuming Gainesville has an average percentage of Jewish community, that would mean that there are roughly 3,700 Jews in Gainesville.

But even thugh they lose, i stay strong. Stay strong for the Americans and soon enough youll get rewarded with good play.

One sure way to find out what something is worth is test the price that the market will bear, i.e. put it on Ebay.  Assuming Ebay is (more or less) a fair marketplace at the time at which you sell the item then the marketplace can give you an idea of what the item is worth. \\n\\nPricing an item this way also "automatically" takes into account the condition of the item and (because of the size and scope of Ebay) also takes into account the rarity of the item.  Where such a method fails is in the assumption: if the marketplace isn't fair (your item doesn't have the proper exposure or the people who are interested in your item aren't looking on Ebay) then you will of course fail to realize its true value.\\n\\nBut I still think Ebay will give you a good 1st-order approximation.\\n\\nWhile a newspaper

Hydrochlorothiazide (Apo-Hydro®, Aquazide H®, Microzide®, Oretic®), sometimes abbreviated HCT, HCTZ, or HZT is a popular diuretic drug that acts by inhibiting the kidney's ability to retain water. This reduces the volume of the blood, decreasing peripheral vascular resistance.
If you are talking cancer with brain mets, this means that the cancer has spread to the brain area.  It may or may not hurt depending on the symptoms or where the cancer is first located in the body.  If there are tumors in the brain you may experience some headaches, vision changes, dizziness or balance problems, or neurological changes with numbness and tingling in the hands and feet or limbs of the body. It may have paralyzing limb changes, speech changes, memory changes, and stroke like symptoms as well.  This also depends on the staging of the cancer that the doctor decides with further testing, such as CT scans, MRI's and blood tests.  The mets ususally means metastasized, that it is more advanced and has originated in a different spot in the body to begin with.

It should be placed in a strategic place so that when it comes to marketing your product you'll be on top. \\n\\nWell this is a really rough gudeline to starting a business.

The Eclectic Pop of Escape Pod\\n \\nESCAPE POD: Losing Control (7-inch Single on Dead Digital)\\n\\nThis single from 2003 offers an all too-brief dose of eclectic pop.\\n\\nCombining raw electronics and low-fi folk sensibilities, Escape Pod generates a sound that is haunting but reassuring. The minimal electronics are finely restrained to the point where the sparseness creates a lusher sound than the components, a flow expertly embellished by the vocal harmonies that describe unrequited wishes. Sedate drums and gentle guitar flesh out the compositions, delivering the ethereal sound into more accessible territory.\\n\\nComparable to the Pixies and Beck, Escape Pod's music provides a serene access to tuneage of less demanding quality, providing sonic refuge among airwaves overcrowded with harsh noise.

dajjal is an evil figure in Islamic eschatology, who will appear before Yaum al-Qiyamah (Day of the Resurrection). He is highly similar to the Antichrist in Christianity.\\nVarious hadith, or traditions, are preserved about the attributes of ad-Dajjal like the following:\\n\\n1.He will be physically misshapen, and have one eye. There will be skin covering the area where the other eye is supposed to be .\\n2.He will deceive the faithful, teaching them that Heaven is Hell and vice versa. \\n3.He will have the power to work miracles in order to mislead believers. \\n4.He will try to put Man on God's throne. \\n5.He will have the Arabic letters kaf, fa and ra (kafir) -meaning unbeliever- branded on his forehead. \\n6.He will have the ability to revive the dead, and consequently claim to be God. \\n7.Some traditions of Islam relate that he will appear at Isfahan, and that he will rally the Isfahan Jews and many women to his support.\\nThe Prophet Muhammad asked his followers to recite the first and last ten verses of Chapter 'The Cave' as protection from the Dajjal. These verses deal with the beliefs and activities of the Christian nations. He also taught his followers to pray, "O Allah! I seek refuge in Thee from the trial of the Dajjal." He also said, There is no tribulation greater than that of the Dajjal from the creation of Adam to the day of resurrection.\\nThe occurrence of the Dajjal will correspond with the appearance of the Imam Mahdi, who will rally the faithful on earth to oppose him. Eventually, Isa (the name of Jesus in Arabic) will return from Heaven and slay the Dajjal. According to many interpretations this will occur near The Gate of Ludd (ancient city of Lydda) [1]. This will be followed by a Golden Age for Islam (not to be confused with the separate Islamic Golden Age) in which there are only true believers and almost everyone converts to Islam. Eventually decline will set in and by the will of Allah the End will come for Man. This is similar to a retelling of the Christian apocalypse where the end comes with the return of Jesus and Judgment Day.\\nHe is mentioned in Chapter 16 of "The Arabian Nights": "Sinbad Voyage 1" or "First Voyage"\\n\\n"Also to while away the time of waiting I explored a little island named Cassel, which belonged to King Mihrage, and which was supposed to be inhabited by a spirit named Deggial. Indeed, the sailors assured me that often at night the playing of timbals could be heard upon it."

That would depend on the consequences. And whether those consequences affect you. Getting arrested for indecent exposure is not all that funny.

The larger crystals in granite tell us that it formed deep underground.  Geologists call such rocks intrusive igneous rocks.  Insulated from the coolness of earth's surface, the molten rock (magma--molten rock underground) cooled slowly and the crystals had time to grow large.  Basalt flowed onto earth's surface as molten rock (lava--molten rock on earth's surface) and there it cooled quickly, so the crystals had little time to grow.  Geologists call such rocks extrusive igneous rocks.\\n\\nThere are other differences between granites and basalts, but I think speed of cooling, related to where the molten rock cooled, answers your question.
Not sitting too close to the televison screen was something people were worried about in the 1950s and '60s, but not so much recently. There *are* some worries about "video display terminals" (monitors), actually.\\n\\n"Virtually no one believes that under ordinary circumstances television watching poses any special danger. (Well, physically, anyway.) Prior to 1968 or so some sets emitted excessive X-rays, but that problem has now been eliminated. More recently concern has arisen about computer video display terminals (VDTs), which typically are viewed at much closer range than televisions; research is inconclusive so far but continuing. To be on the safe side some eye doctors say you shouldn't let your kids get closer than five feet to the TV screen, the room shouldn't be pitch black, etc. But the intention is to prevent eye fatigue, not eye damage."
Well, I used to think it was Richard Nixon, but at least he recognized a losing war when he saw it and cut his losses.

Many people are Christian in name only. They go to church, do all the "right" things (with a few indiscretions), and think that is all there is to it.

Things have a way of being found out though... the truth always comes back around.\\n\\nSo is this judging one another? Yes. The question is really; how much do you love God? How much do you love others? Show me by what you do. Let me understand by what you say. You may not be responsible for the decisions that another makes, but you do have an influence. Our decisions often affects others by our examples.
How is Brainboost different from existing engines like Google?\\n\\nBrainboost is an answer engine whereas Google is a Search engine.\\n\\nWhat that means is that Brainboost actually finds answers to your questions posed in plain English as opposed to directing you to pages that simply mention the questions.\\n\\nBrainboost, Using the AnswerRank™ system, intelligently reads hundreds of web pages derived from search results and extracts just the short and concise answer to your question, saving you time.\\n\\nFollowing is a simplistic explanation showing the process of both engines\\n\\n    Google\\n\\n    * User types in : “Why is mars red”\\n    * Google Search engine retrieves all pages containing words "mars" and red".\\n    * Search results are sorted by the number of links each one of them got from other pages. This is a good way to figure out which one of them is most trusted by others.\\n    * Results are displayed with the snippet being the appearance of the question on the pages\\n    * Typically, a user would then click on the first search result, read through the document and hope to find an answer.\\n    * If an answer is not found within the first search result, the user needs to repeat this process with the next search result, sometimes having to read many web pages to finally get at the answer.\\n\\n\\n    Brainboost\\n\\n    * User types in : “Why is mars red”\\n    * Brainboost translates the query into multiple queries that will raise the probability of finding the ANSWER to the question.\\n    * Brainboost retrieves search engine results.\\n    * Brainboost retrieves top several hundred pages and reads them.\\n    * Brainboost finds answers and ranks them based on it's proprietary AnswerRank™ technology. AnswerRank™ knows to look at a set of many possible answers and rank them as to which one is probably the most correct. In this case: "Mars is red because of the iron in the soil"\\n    * Brainboost displays the ANSWERS to the user\\n\\nSo you see, Brainboost is a fundamentally different way to find knowledge. Whereas Search engines force you to spend time searching for that piece of information, Brainboost does that for you by automatically reading the search results and extracting the precious answer to your question.\\n\\nWhen you add up all time we spend plowing through search results for an answer, this functionality translates to hours of time saved.\\n\\nWhile search engines like MSN and Ask Jeeves have recently made limited attempts at answering questions from finite databases or precanned editorially collected answers, Brainboost is the only engine that leverages the full knowledge available on the web.\\n\\nBrainboost. It’s the next evolutionary step in search engines.

The manager defines the tactics of the team, decides which players to play in every game, and decides which player the team should buy (Generally).

Time travel is completly possible. \\n\\nwhen Albert Einstein released his theory of special relativity, he laid the foundation for the theoretical possibility of time travel. As we all know, no one has successfully demonstrated time travel, but no one has been able to rule it out either. \\n\\nIf you travel at the speed of light, time stops for you, not for other people. So say you travel at the speed of ligt for a week in space, when you come back to earth youll find that its been maybe 100 years in the future.\\n\\nI also know a russian astronaught (<--- Spelling wrong) that traveled a fraction of a seconed in the future. This is because he was aboard the russian space station. If you travel fast enough for a long period of time its possible.\\n\\nThere is a scientist that is building this machine, its suppose to be able to send particles into the future or past i forgot, but when this person turns the time machine on, he could start getting messages from the future.\\n\\nBut yes time travel is possible.
there's a #1 and a #3, but #2, as the compromise candidate, is by far the most common.\\n\\n#1 pencils have a harder lead, meaning a lighter color and finer line. Also, they don't wear down as quickly. On the other hand #3 have a softer lead, giving a thicker, darker line and quick wear that requires frequent sharpening. there are even some numbers beyond that but you are only likely to find them in specialty stores, such as art supply.

Airplanes are NOT restricted to flying at altitudes greater than 10,000 meters. Many high-performance military jets routinely fly at altitudes of 13,000 meters and higher.

Hopkins, Johns, 1795—1873, American financier and philanthropist, founder of Johns Hopkins Univ., b. Anne Arundel co., Md. In 1819 he founded his own commission firm, later known as Hopkins Brothers, and also went into banking. He later had a large part in the growth of the Baltimore & Ohio RR, of which he became a director in 1847. His cognizance of Baltimore's lack of medical facilities in times of epidemic and his own scant education led him to bequeath, a few years before his death, $7 million for the founding of a free hospital and Johns Hopkins Univ.
They will probably get conditional draft pick(s) for him. He is coming off an injury and didn't do so hot last season before he injured, so no other team is going to be stupid enough to invest too much in him until he has proven he is worth it. Where he goes, nobody knows yet, but I'm betting it's Oakland. They just cut Collins, so they have room in the cap to get DC. The thinking also is teaming up DC and Moss again will be great, but I don't think it will be as good as it has been in the past. DC is coming off injury and will be "gun shy" for the first season at least, and Moss is past his prime. He still a few good years left, but not great years. He's been sitting out games with injuries he would have played through a few years ago, and he is slowing down.\\n\\nWhat the Vikes need to do is keep Johnson as starter and draft a QB 1st round that they can groom. Johnson has 1, maybe 2 years left as a starter. Their running game is what is really hurting ever since Robert Smith retired. With all the money they have to spend this year, they can get a good back in free agency that can do 20+ carries a game (James or Lewis), and get some good defensive players for the new "Dungy D" or "Tampa 2", or whatever they are calling it now. The front O line may need some tweaking, but with Birk coming back, that alone will greatly improve it's performance.

To be honest, your gonna have to be real with yourself. Only you know why you love the both of them. Don't leave one if you feel that your heart is with the one your leaving. You were with him for 11 years, it really doesn't matter if it was off and on it obviously had a meaning to it b/c you still love him after all of that time spent together. You need to sit back alone and figure out what both of them bring to the table. Think about everything that the guy you were with for 11 yrs. gave you. Remember nothin powers over understanding and happiness. If he doesn't make you happy inside & out and show you that he actually understands you regaurdless of the situation btwn you 2. Then maybe you were supposed to fall for the next guy, think about why you both were together for 11yrs. and you are just now thinking of marraige. Where there problems, issues, anything that stopped the both of you from growing. Only you know the answer to those questions. Just remember that your destined to be happy and explore a new and exciting life when you actually get married to someone. Make sure that whoever you choose deserves to share that happiness with you.

There are reasons, and mainly they have to do with power supply kicking off, pulling a lot of current and then your hard drive spin up. They are using air as bearings for the drive, so they float when running but when off sit metal on metal. \\n\\nIt is like starting a car, a lot of things are happening and typically that is when a car fails. \\n\\nAlso, if you mean just rebooting all the time, that is because windows creates virtual memory allocations of your hard drive for swap memory. These tend to get fragmented and take up a lot of memory if you just power off without shutting down. If you have done a lot of these, just fragment your hard drive and that will clean up the fragmentation, just not the files themselves.
I don't think so.\\n\\nFor one thing, even if one could transfer the genetic materials correctly, there is no way a human could have the "proportional strength of a spider" or ant or anything like that. The physical nature of muscules will not scale up like that. The strongest one could get is, well, as strong as the strongest human, whoever that is.\\n\\nThe web material seems fictional as well. For one thing, what sort of glad (or tiny device) could generate so much material without either (1) lots of refills, (2) a huge tank.

Obviously, there is a minimum population beyond which there are simply not enough people to make up a functioning country.  Beyond that, there needs to be enough people to have a fully functional economy.  That is, the major professions and trades must be adequately represented, as well as entrepreneurs and investors, support staff and other service workers, etc.  \\n\\nOnce there are enough to run the country, you start to see the disadvantages of too much population:  pressure on natural resources and infrastructure, housing and job scarcity, crowding causing delays in transportation, retail trade, etc.  Overpopulation also means a higher percentage of non-productive consumers than the system can most efficiently accommodate.  This causes pressure to create bureaucracy to control the excess population, including the increased crime rate caused by crowding.\\n\\nI do not know of any studies of what the optimum population is for a given type of geography under a given level of developments, etc., but most of the "civilized" world is overcrowded rather than too sparsely populated.  The only exceptions, like Canada, tend to be those in rather extremes of physical conditions.\\n\\nEnough to get you started?

Dogs don't think that way. You're projecting human thought patterns and behaviours onto animals, and that's simply not how their mind works. I read a great article about a month ago (I forget where) about an animal psychologist talking about this sort of thing, how a lot of problems with pets are caused by thinking about them in human terms. For example, one woman's dog started causing havok when she got a full-time job and left him home in the house. She thought he was angry at her, but that's not something dogs could even comprehend. No, it was rather that the dog was simply very confused and didn't understand what was going on, and figuring this out saved the dog from having to be put down (he almost bit someone).\\n\\nBasically, no. Chimpanzees and other such evolutionary cousins might, but your common house pets cannot think that way.

they are very common benign tumors (the most common tumor in women) of the smooth muscle tissue in the muscular layer of the uterus. They are a celular proliferation of fusiform cells  with very low mitotic activity that usually arise in several groups.\\n\\nThey are benign, I insist, because they are well limited and have little or no mitotic activity (cell division), which isn't irregular either (the DNA does not get mutated when they divide). they may cause bleeding or discomfort, which is why the woman should go to her gyno. surgical treatment is usually completely curative and doesn't involve any loss of function (as in a histerectomy or anything).

If you take a really strong and careful interest in things, and associate new information with experiences and ideas that you're well-versed-in, that should help a lot. In my experience, it's often a matter of convincing yourself to care more deeply about whatever information is coming your way. If you approach new facts with the attitude of intensity and (reasonable) amazement, stuff just tends to stick.

Working with your hands? Writing? Traveling? As long as it's not "sitting around watching TV" or something (and really, most of us would get bored pretty quickly with that), there should be a number of potential careers that allow you to do that.\\n\\nMost importantly, no career, no matter how lucrative, is the right career for you if you don't enjoy doing it.
In nature, living things evolve through changes in their DNA. In an animal like a chicken, DNA from a male sperm cell and a female ovum meet and combine to form a zygote -- the first cell of a new baby chicken. This first cell divides innumerable times to form all of the cells of the complete animal. In any animal, every cell contains exactly the same DNA, and that DNA comes from the zygote. \\n\\nChickens evolved from non-chickens through small changes caused by the mixing of male and female DNA or by mutations to the DNA that produced the zygote. These changes and mutations only have an effect at the point where a new zygote is created. That is, two non-chickens mated and the DNA in their new zygote contained the mutation(s) that produced the first true chicken. That one zygote cell divided to produce the first true chicken. \\n\\nPrior to that first true chicken zygote, there were only non-chickens. The zygote cell is the only place where DNA mutations could produce a new animal, and the zygote cell is housed in the chicken's egg. So, the egg must have come first.

It is okay to cry when someone dies. I am sure the person who has died has cried when they have lost someone dear to them too. Crying is a way to begin healing from OUR loss. It is healthier to cry and let our feelings out. Of course, praying is a good way too. Again, I am sorry for your loss.
Try going to a music store that sells music books in classical vocal or the music library, they should have the libretto(text)as well as the CD of the song or you may try Google and type Ave Maria. There are many versions of Ave Maria, be sure it's Schubert. If you need anything else e-mail me Klm4k8@umkc.edu. And you can try iTunes or classical CD of Schubert. :O)

It seems to me that you had something very special with this guy there are not many guys that will allow you to share your bedroom with others seems you had the best of both worlds. Well what can we do to get you back in, right now he is not going to trust you right away so get use to that your road will be a hard one when you are not togather he will assume that you are with someone else can you handle that if so hang in there for as long as you can if it gets to be to heavy for you try to just be his friend/sex partner but tell him what you want from now on good luck........

Try:\\n\\nhttp://www.teenfreeway.com\\n\\nIt's aimed at teenagers but I have gotten some great makeup and hair product stuff from there!\\n\\nI remembered you were from Canada so I found this freebies site just for Canadians:\\nhttp://www.somewhereincanada.com/freebies/links/\\n\\n\\nBe careful about signing up for things from freebie sites, they will spam you A LOT usually.

Firstly, the milky way is in a galatic cluster, and that is in a super cluster.  (There's a lot of gravity out there.)  But those structures are too far away to detect sideway movement, only towards or away.  Also, their motion is highly relativistic.  So Galaxy is a natural place to stop.\\n\\nThe first figure will probably be within the margin of error for the second and third.  So, as I check wikipedia, I see that the sun is orbitting the galaxy at a rate of 217 kilometer per second and the earth is rotating around the sun at 29.783 km/s.  So, this person has traveled somewhere in excess (depending on how many seconds more than 46 years old they are) of 358,242,443,236.8 kilometers, or 222,468,557,250.0528 miles.  \\n\\nAlso, just as a comment, there is no "point" of the big bang.  It happened to the entire universe at once.  It's all expanding everywhere.
I think that the administration at your son's school should want take bullying much more seriusly. With all of the school shootings in the last couple of years, I don't know why they would want something like this to go unresolved. I would remind the administration of what happened at Columbine. If they don't want the same thing to happen at their school and it easily could, no school is safe! You may want to share with them the play "Bang Bang You're Dead." It is a play dedicated to ending school violence. Your son's school needs to get its students active AGAINST school violence. There should be zero tolerance for it!! Having the students put on this play could be a start to the education process. Also seek out other parents to go to the administration and take a stand. Contact the Parent Teacher Organization and educate them. They are not going to want to have their child potentially put in danger.
A nice open question and so much to talk about! Where to begin???\\n\\nOk I'll talk about what happens when you drive away in a car. The acceleration needed for a car to move from standstill is proportional to the force applied (by the engine). While you have a force from the engine pushing the car forwards, there are always opposing forces - such as friction from the air, the axles and tyres. These reduce the amount by which the car accelerates away. When you pull away you start in 1st gear (usually). This is so that the car has enough power to pull away. A car could not pull away in its highest gear for example. This is because in a low gear, the input speed (from the engine) is converted into such a speed which allows the car to pull away. You can only go slowly in this gear, but at least you can pull away with plenty of power. For higher gears, your car will tend to be already in motion (i.e. it has momentum). It does not therefore require much power to allow an increase in speed. So high gears are good for high speeds, but the car finds it harder to pull away.\\n\\nWhen you are travelling at a constant speed, the forces are balanced, so the force that the engine applies is equal to the opposing forces such as friction. It is important to quote Newton's 1st law - a body will continue in uniform motion unless acted upon by an external force. This applies in the above situation but friction complicates the matter. Say there was no friction, then for the car to travel at constant speed, no force would need to be applied (ever) once it had reached that constant speed.\\n\\nIf you need to use the brakes to come to a stop, these use friction to slow you down. Typically disc brakes are connected to the wheel and pads press on the discs to slow the wheels (and therefore the car) down. The brakes use a hydraulic system which only needs the driver to apply a small pressure on the pedal for the pads to exert a larger pressure on the discs. This happens because the freedom of movement in the brake pedal is long, whereas it is small in the brake pads. This difference allows a much larger pressure to be applied to the brake discs. Also note that road surface conditions and tyre conditions have a considerable effect on the braking distance - ice and water increase braking distance considerably. Some cars use an anti-lock braking system which works by releasing the tyres when skidding is detected so that the tyre will gain grip followed by more braking. This technique helps to decrease braking distances. \\n\\nI could go on but I must stop now!

This Week in Tech is a great podcast.  It's hosted by Leo Laport (of TechTV fame) and features several guests each week, usually other ex-TechTV people and John Devorak.  It's basically a discussion of tech news stories from the week.  It's been the top podcast for some time now, probably because of the well known, intelligent hosts as well as the professional production quality.\\n\\nBrowsing the podcasts available on iTunes can be a good way to easily sample some podcasts on topics you're interested in.
I love the answer you got from "girlhotj" after all you didn't specify if you were looking for a boyfriend.  \\n\\nThen again maybe your question is not about if anybody wants to be with you... maybe you are just taking a survey of how many people are looking for a significant other online.

When you're doing homework, just remember it could be worse.  There have been days this year when I've attended classes and done homework from 9 in the morning to 4:30 in the morning.  Actually, for the most part, I love school... or I wouldn't do that. :-P\\n\\nI'm guessing your somewhere between 6th and 10th grade.  I can assure you that school gets much more enjoyable when you finish high school.  But that doesn't do you a whole lot of good for the time being.  Are there any subjects you like?  Do you dislike school because it's boring (i.e. too easy), or because it's too hard?  Homework in middle/high school tends to suck because it's primarily busy work.  Not a whole lot to do about that apparet from just not doing it (unless you actually do need the practice or the grade, in which case you should do it anyway).

A probe going to another galaxy may indeed find life. It could also be inellegent. The only problem is that it would (with current and planned technology) take centuries for the probes to arrive.The fastest spacecraft we have today is the one heading for pluto. It will take ten years just to get there and that's in our own solar system. There may be life elsewhere even in our own galaxy. But there are literally billions of stars just in the Milky Way Galaxy. The cost of space flight will prohibit extensive exploration, at least for the forseeable future. As for the race of hypothetical beings, It is hard to imagine that with the randomness and sheer numbers of life on earth as an example, we'd find similar beings in terms of physical appearance.\\nOne more issue would be the radiation damage a space probe would incur during a flight of this duration. Even a short time in space is damaging for complex and sensative objects (human and machine). Cosmic radiation floods space with sub-atomic particles traveling at or near the speed of light. Those particles pierce and pass through what ever it is they run into (except several very dense elements). The damage occurs to the probe on a microscopic level. The eletronics, computer chips and sensors begin to look like swiss cheese after enough exposure. There may be solutions to these problems in the future, but for now they are another prohibitive factor for extensive space exploration.
A bipolar disorder is also known as a maniac disorder. \\n\\nThis is a very dangerous phycholigical sickness in which a person can go completely nuts. That person may not only stop caring for their personal needs, but could also become dangerous to themselves,(could committ suicide), or dangerous to others around them,(could kill someone), if early treatment is not provided.\\n\\nIf you know someone with this disease, you should consult a psychologist immediately before its too late. A person with this disease could lead a normal life with proper medication and regular visit to their psychologist. If treatment is not provided for a long time,then there is also a risk of the patient going nuts forever
Once a viral DNA is intergrated in the host's genome, viral genes can be expressed, which means that viral proteins will be produced (anabolism). So, may be not direct anabolism in the strictest sense that evry building up reaction is controlled by the viral DNA, but they do direct the anabolism of molecules that are important for their survival once in the host.

The only way I can think of is never to send emails with your email account and never tell anyone what your email address is.  But that kind of defeats the purpose of having an email address.  If you get too much, you can change to another email address and be more careful about who you give your address to.  It still won't be foolproof.  \\n\\nYou can set up spam filters in most email accounts.  But the spammers are working hard to get around those too.
'The 39 steps' is a book by John Buchan. Three film version have been made of it. All of the films have changed parts of the book. The 1978 film version did end in Big Ben but this is not 'the 39 steps'. Its generally regarded as the worst of the 3 films, however a fourth is in production. Big ben has more steps but this part is not currently open to the public. \\n\\nThe 39 steps is in a small coast town in Kent. Its a path down a cliff where you could leave / join your waiting boat.
I couldn't do it for the longest time either.  i thought i never would.  then i was with a guy that actually cared to find what i like.  it was like the mental block was lifted!  i get off more often than not now.  you just have to know what you like and go for it.  just get lost in the feelings.  deep grinding works well for me, but the g spot is the best. a little messy at times, but definitely worth it.
I'm not exactly a scholar of Arkansas state law, put a prenup is, first, a contract.  So it has to have all the same things a contract does.  The parties have to understand it, agree to it, and each give up something of value.  All of its terms have to be written down and it has to be sufficiently detailed so that it's not an "agreement to agree."\\n\\nPrenups are frequently signed between people of unequal power - one wealthy, one less so.  For that reason, most states will insist that the parties be given some extra rights.  Each must have access to an attorney, ample time to consider the prenup, and must have received fairly complete disclosure about the finances of the other.  One or more of these may be waived but the more unequal the position of the parties, the less likely courts will be to allow such waivers. \\n\\nSome states also require prenups to be sworn and notarized, a requirement not necessary for your average contract.\\n\\nAnd couples will have a hard time making an agreement about child support and visitation.  These issues are almost always open for the courts to re-decide them.

You should specify more the programming language context.\\n\\nIn general, passing by value means the subprogramme that receives the value gets a copy and cannot, thus, modify the original variable used by the caller. It's often said that the function may not produce side-effects.\\n\\nPassing by reference allows for side effects.\\n\\nBut many languages make this a little more complicated. You may pass a "reference" or a "pointer" by value, which means that the original pointer will still point to the same object/memory area when the subprogramme returns. But if the pointer is not marked constant, then the contents pointed to may suffer changes.
There are more taxes placed on business than indivuals. And what you see is the effect of taxing the businesses which trickles down to the consumer, which is us. So when a business gets more taxes they have to make money to pay it. So, that ends up to be part of the extra money we have to pay to the companies. Someone has to pay it..

Wouldn't it be worse if you had sex with him and then broke up and you found out that was all he had been waiting for?  I'm sorry, I know that it hurts to break up but don't let that be influenced by the whole sex question.

It is still something special that you will be able to share with the guy of your dreams one day.

Cajuns are people who are of the "Acadia" French living in Novia Scotia (Canada) that resettled in South Louisiana.  They were entirely Catholic and came to escape religious persecution under Protestant England's rule 1800s.  They take their culture very seriously and live in the area called ACADIANA stretching from Lake Charles to New Orleans on Interstate 10.  They are known for festivals, famous cuisine, warm hospitality, broken accents, laid back attitude, and Acadian architecture.  The X-generation was the last to have French everyday in public schools through 7th grade.  French remains the first language spoken by all prior to the Baby Boomers.  Almost every little town has its own unique community and people feel a sense of pride in continuing the tradition for generations.  People have common last names like Hebert, Billeaud, Guidry, Comeaux, Bergeron, and pages of each exist in the phone books.
Routine eye exams usually cost $35-70 in my area.  Generally, you get what you pay for.  Be careful of the bait and switch tactics of the cheapest places.  They will tell you $19 for the exam, then get you in the chair and tell you that you need $235 of additional testing or your eyes will fall out!  Ask what the exam includes when you shop around.  \\n\\nI think the better question is to ask your friends and neighbors if they like their eye doctor!  If the doctor is nice, honest, and cares for your eyes, you are getting your money's worth, whatever the price.

You would have to add up all the prices of shares times the number of shares for the proper weighting they recive in the index or etf. Then add up all the earnings per share times the number of shares.

I was hesitant about walking also, mainly because I really didn't know any of my peers in my graduating class either.  However, I did because there was that whole parental guilt trip thing "We've waited so long to see you graduate!"  I also did find out that some colleges, mainly the larger universities, don't even have ceremonies where their graduates walk.  All their graduates do is just stand up when their specific school/major is announced.  That's pretty lame because you get no recognition whatsoever.  So if your ceremony actually will call your name, I don't think it would be so bad to attend.
That is very hard to say. It depends upon the marriage and the sexual desires of everyone involved and your meaning of love making. No two marriages are alike. You can make love all day and not have intercouse. Take my fiance and myself, well we are hot and heavy because I just have to touch him all the time. I MEAN ALL DAY. We are sexual that way.   That however, doesn't mean that if your not having sex 3 times a day your marriage isn't working.  Take my advice, FOREPLAY, is the one of the keys to a healthy marriage.

There are very few universities in the US that take students based only on TOEFL scores. One of them is Oregon Institute of Science and Technology (I am specifically talking about the Masters in Biology program. I do not know about the others). All the other universities will need a GRE score along with the TOEFL score. Some universities might even ask you for a subject GRE score. To specifically answer your question, 99.5% of the universities do not take in students without a GRE score.

Yes there ever can be peace on earth. My assertion can happen but not without the mutual efforts of civilize societies to eradicate religious extremism which breeds terrorism. There is need for educating many religious zealots - "extremists", who think they are the best in culture/tradition and so their religion is the best and most perfect. Thus they choose to call them of other religious sects or them without religious affiliations as infidels. These religious extremists are trully ignorant and don't use their education little or enough to enhance their social standing. They are always not curious or anxious to pry their holy books but are at the mercy of their religious leaders to brainwash them - "MASTER says". May I suggest that civil religious persons and society - both christians, moslems, hindus, budhists, etc should know noone was created infidel by God. God scales noone infidel. The extremists should be taught to respect everyone's social or religious standing. The whole civilize world should educate rather than support these zealots and there ever will be peace on earth.
The positives can be stained, the others can't. The staining possibility is an advantage for further research under a microscope. There is even more to it because Gram-positive bacteria belong to a separate phylum different from the Gram negatives.  The stain becomes possible by a high amount of peptidoglycan in the cell wall, which typically, but not always lacks the secondary membrane and lipopolysaccharide layer found in Gram-negative bacteria

No; the failure of a court system to convict a person does not logically imply that a person is truly innocent of the crime.  By the same token, the success of a court to convice someone does not logically imply that a person is truly guilty of the crime.  The courts do not seek to fully and logically prove things, only to establish them beyond reasonable doubt.\\n\\nSo, if the system is reasonably sure a person is guilty, they are punished.  If the system is reasonably sure a person is innocent, they are not punished.\\n\\nThe statement "innocent until proven guilty" simply defines the algorithm the government will follow in the case that it is not possible to reasonably determine whether a person is guilty or innocent.\\n\\nThe law isn't about strict logic as no empirical science can be, but is rather about fair and effective implementation of the law.

Anyone that uses the web or other internet technologies can benefit from learning at least the very basics of networking, for example, the difference between a telephone cable and a Cat5 ethernet cable and the places they plug into on the back of your computer. \\n\\nKnowing the difference between public and private networks, how data travels from one computer to another, and how to troubleshoot problems can save you money and frustration, but for many people it's easier to pay someone like me $80 an hour to fix it for them (fast).\\n\\nIf you work in IT or use networks on a regular basis, it would be very beneficial to study up on TCP/IP and Ethernet basics. Once you understand how things work it makes it much easier to figure out why it's not doing what you want it to do.\\n\\nHere's a good quick tutorial on TCP/IP:\\nhttp://www.w3schools.com/tcpip/default.asp

There is nothing in Canada for foreigners. Be more ambitious and aim for America. Canadians do not recognize foreign credentials. I knew this lady whose husband was doing his gradauate work back in China or Hong Kong, he emigrated to Canada with his family, Canadians pushed him back to being a second-year undergraduate. So please, for your sake, and your children sake avoid Canada at all costs. The Canadian government is getting sued for lying to immigrants. Trust me, if you graduate from a Canadian university you won't find a job because you lack "Canadian work experience". There's this story of this guy who wanted to find a job at a fast-food restaurant and they asked him,"Do you have a university degree." Trust me, there is more opportunity in America and your degree will have more meaning internationally. Besides, Canada is one of the countries on the world where PH.Ds drive cabs. AIM FOR AMERICA.Don't heed my advice at your risk.\\n  I know.I have experienced both.\\n   By the way, OSAP only applies to Canadian citizens or permanent residents.
Actually,\\nsmart middle eastern countries are preparing for this.\\nTake Dubai as an example.\\nThey are foreseeing that oil will run out at sometime in the near future. So what they are transitioning into a tourist attraction. They are infact building super luxury manmade islands in the shape of the continents, and have built a super luxury island in the shape of a palm tree!!! Since I am a proffesional soils engineer i can tell you that what they are doing there is truly magnificent in engineering terms and very smart in terms of business. \\n\\nSo in a way you are already right in your question. Dubai is already selling sand!!! And even more amazing, wealthy people are already buying it at astounding prices!!!
if you care about this guy that much and he does you no matter what you do for him is sure is goin to be great. but some thought in to in. talk to his family and friends  have afun make it unforgetable and keep in touch. he may not be your boyfriend but he can be your friend and that is better then nothing.
I actually impress people when I tell them the truth of my age. I am often asked my age at work, I am a server in a private upscale country club, for some reason these members are NOSY! I always reply with "how old do you think I am?" The most popular answer is 24. I smile and tell them I am 39. Their look of shock is priceless! I feel great being at the cusp of forty and would rather be 39 and look like I'm 24 rather than the other way around. It gets irritating sometimes as I am often carded, nah I'm lovin it!

Studies using xylitol as either a sugar substitute or a small dietary addition have demonstrated a dramatic reduction in new tooth decay, along with arrest and even some reversal of existing dental caries. Xylitol provides additional protection that enhances all existing prevention methods. This xylitol effect is long-lasting and possibly permanent. Low decay rates persist even years after the trials have been completed.

All inks are not created equal.  From the base of the chemical composition to colorants and additives, there are many varying combinations used when ink formulas are composed.  Of the three chemical bases used to formulate inks, water and petrochemical solvents are most common.  The third and most atypical base used is oil, found mainly in wide-format commercial printers.\\n\\nThe colorant, or the substance used to give color to the ink, is either dye or pigmentation. Dye, consisting of small molecules, blends with the water-based solution.  A water-dye based ink tints or stains the paper on a molecular level.  Because the dye is composed of single molecules it lays flatter on the paper surface reflecting light more evenly and appearing more vivid. However, the smaller molecular structure of the dye-based ink also allows it to be damaged by UV light more rapidly that pigmented inks.\\n\\n            Pigmented colorant is insoluble. The pigment consists of much larger molecules than that of the dye, therefore the reflection of light received from a pigmented print does not appear as vibrant due to the scattering of the reflected light.  The larger molecules do allow a pigmented ink's print to last substantially longer than a dye-based ink's print.        \\n\\n            In recent years hybrid ink consisting of both dyes and pigmentation has been introduced to the market.  These inks are being used in the latest line of Epson printers.  The hybrid dye/pigment ink is also referred to as archival inks.  The company claims that their archival inks will last twice as long as pigmented ink, close to 200 years.\\n\\n In addition to the chemical base and colorant, inks also contain additives.  Additives may include buffering agents for control of the inks pH levels, resin for resilience, and humectants for the prevention of evaporation.  Other ingredients added to many types of ink may include fungicides, surfactants, and biocides.  Each ink formula has a unique formulation of each additive, again causing dramatic differences in the final outcome.  \\nI hope this helps!
When you are comfortable being single.  You can't incorporate someone else's life with yours until you are comfortable with yours.  Really has a lot to do with being ready to give up a lot personally because you love someone else enough to do so.

Two years ago, I had a part-time job instructing at a college in New York.  There were a few Muslim students from the Middle East and Asia studying there.  None of them said they had been harassed by US immigration when they came from the Middle East; their documents were checked very thoroughly, but they were let into the US without any problem.\\nUnfortunately, the media in the Muslim countries are very similar to those in the West, in that they can mis-report stories and make every little incident into a huge issue.  Personally, I don't trust much of what the media report from any country overseas.  I take into account the experiences that I have had working with people from foreign countries.  I know from experience that most Muslims are kind, gracious people.  And I hope that Muslims will learn that most of us in the West are the same.\\nIt seems to me that the biggest problem Saudi students face when they come to the US to study is that they are placed into a culture that is VERY different from the one in which they were raised.  They do not have to become Westernized, but they do need to understand and accept the differences.\\nPeople of good will , no matter what their culture, can usually work out differences peacefully if they try hard enough.

INSTANT ESPRESSO POWDER: Coffee compliments the flavor of chocolate. Instant espresso powder can be found in Italian delicatessens and many supermarkets.  The most common brand is Medaglia d'Oro. It's a little hard to find, but I found a reliable mail order source. However, brands from major American companies are coming onto the market in reaction to the newfound love for "real" coffee.  If you wish, you can substitute regular instant coffee, but it isn't nearly as intensely flavored.

Relative humidity is the moisture content of air relative to the temperature. Warmer air can hold more moisture (measured in grains) than cold air. If you have 70 degree air at 90 percent humidity and the temperature suddenly dropped to 50 degrees, the humidity level would rise to 100 percent. This is called the saturation or dew point. when the humidity is at 100 percent the air can hold no more moisture and it begins to condensate (fog, dew, rain) until the relative humidity drops below 100 percent. When you wake up and it is foggy (air is at dewpoint) and in a while the sun warms the air and the fog clears, this is an example of a drop in relative humidity.
Encyclopedia or Encyclopaedia, reference work that provides information on a range of subjects. Encyclopedias can encompass many areas of interest, or they can focus on a particular field of study, such as a geographic area, an ethnic group, a time period, or an academic discipline. Most encyclopedias have hundreds or thousands of articles, each addressing a distinct topic. Many of the articles contain illustrations, maps, photographs, and other media elements that help readers understand concepts. For centuries encyclopedias were published as multivolume sets of books, but in the late 20th century they appeared in new formats, such as CD-ROM, digital video disc (DVD), and on the Internet. \\n\\nThe term encyclopedia comes from the Greek words enkyklios paideia, meaning “comprehensive education” and originally signifying instruction in all branches of knowledge, or a comprehensive education in a specific subject. This concept gave rise to the idea of collecting the materials for such instruction into a single work, in which the contents and relations of the various arts and sciences would be explained systematically. Attempts to produce books of this kind were made more than 2,000 years ago, although the name encyclopedia was not given to such works until the 16th century.
The same people who invented the wheel five or six thousand years ago (the Mesopotamians) also fancied the number sixty, basing their entire number system on it. No one seems to know exactly why--it might even have been related to trade: for commercial purposes, it's helpful to use a number that has many factors, and sixty has twelve of them, more than any other manageable number.... Whatever the reason, the Babylonians picked the system up and passed it on to the Egyptians, who used it to divide the circle into 360 degrees (6 x 60) and who also gave us the symbol for degrees. The Egyptians divided spheres into 360 degrees as well, assigning the first latitude and longitude lines to the earth. This ancient system for dividing the circle has persisted to the present. Each degree of the circle is divided into 60 minutes (60') and each minute into 60 seconds (60").\\n\\nFor more information about the origin of the system for dividing a circle into 360 degrees see also:\\n\\nBynum, W. F. Dictionary of the History of Science, Princeton University Press, Princeton, N.J., 1981. (R 509 B99) \\n"Circle -- History", Encyclopedia Americana, (1992) vol. 6, p.733. \\nGettings, Fred.

Starch doesn't taste sweet because stach IS NOT a sugar. (Take notes Mashira).\\n\\nStarch is composed of lots of sugar molecules strung together, but because they are strung together out tongues don't detect them as being sweet.\\n\\nBoiling a potato loosens the starch up and makes it digestible, but it doesn't change the primary chemical structure. It starts out as starch and it is still starch after boiling. Boiling doesn't convert it into sugar.\\n\\nAs Dan says, you need to expose the starch to digestive enzymes to convert it to sugar.

Kwanzaa (Kwaanza) is a week-long secular holiday honoring African-American heritage, observed from December 26 to January 1 each year, almost exclusively by African-Americans in the United States of America, though Africans of the diaspora in many countries have begun to practice its observances as well.\\n\\nKwanzaa consists of seven days of celebration, featuring activities such as candle-lighting and pouring of libations, and culminating in a feast and gift-giving. It was founded by black nationalist Dr. Ron "Maulana" Karenga, and first celebrated from December 26, 1966, to January 1, 1967. Karenga calls Kwanzaa the African American branch of "first fruits" celebrations of classical African cultures.

Ok to take on your first question first: Ketones are breakdown products of fatty acids. In diabetic people who have low glucose (eg. if you take too much insulin, or a Type 2 diabetic doesnt take their meds) the cells in your body eg.liver and muscle start utilizing other sources of energy. As a result of these "abnormal" pathways being activated, fats are broken down into ketones rather than a molecule known as Acetyl CoA. This is a problem because ketones are highly acidic, and their buildup causes a condition known as Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) which can lead to serious consequences if left untreated.\\n\\nNow, with regards to your second question, I strongly recommend going to your doctor rather than getting info about drugs from the internet. This is because not only are you different, being a diabetic, but you may also have other factors (age, sex, pregnancy, other conditions, genotypic variations) that make you react differently to drugs.
Having traveled to Amsterdam about four times I can tell you the scoop.  Marijuana is legal however most people there try not to glamorize it so dont attempt to just pull a joint and smoke up in some of the bars and restaurants around Dam Square.  However they have cafe's  or they are called "coffee shops"  Go in there, you can order green tea (most have no alcohol) and then ask for the weed menu.  On this menu it gives you the rundown on all the varieties they sell at the bar.  Some bars even have a small sample attached so you can smell it.  When you decide what you want just order it.  You can walk the streets while smoking a joint, just dont go puffing into businesses like grocery stores to the front desk of the hotel.  Imagine you live in a society where nobody can smoke indoors (imagine you live in California) just dont smoke inside.  However I smoked a lot in the hotel.  \\n\\nMushrooms... sorry they closed the shops just this year.  You cant get dry mushrooms anymore, however ask about wet mushrooms, but I believe they went away too.  \\n\\nCrack, coke, lsd, the worx.  You can get them in dam square just hang around the statues at night, you will see dirty looking people, they can get you pretty much everything.  Just dont eat the stuff out of thier bottle.  I think its dirty dirty meth...  I just guessed, but im not into the hard hard stuff.  just and FYI...
I assume you are talking about Windows XP SP2. It is so much better than service pack 1 because it includes so many more security and performance fixes than sp1. It takes up so much space because it is a lot of fixes, has some new features, and it has an uninstaller. Yes, you can roll back to SP1, so it needs a lot of backup files. Don't ask me why, I don't get it.\\nThe new features are Win XP yelling at you if you don't have Firewall or Antivirus software, or if it is off or outdated. Also, it has a lame firewall. Still better than nothing though.

I'm Mexican-American and honestly, personally, i think that the U.S. is better than Mexico at soccer. i mean i grew up in a "Latin" neighborhood and i understand both sides of arguments on who is better at this sport. Mexicans believe they are better than the U.S. at soccer for the same reason the U.S. think they are better than Japan at baseball, they are more passionate about the sport than the U.S. are. Americans are more passionate about baseball (or at least i think they are) than Japan is, but if you ask a Japanese Person the same question about baseball, obviously they would respond that Japan is better than the U.S. at baseball just cause they won the WBC. Anyway to make a long story short, U.S. is better than Mexico at soccer but Mexico is definitely more passionate about soccer than the U.S. is.

Ok. 'Biotic' comes from bio=life, living. \\n'Action', I'm supposing you know what that is. \\n'Inter' is a prefix that indicates, in this case, reciprocal.\\nThe reciprocal interactions among living things are extremely diverse. For simplification purposes, ecologists tend to classify them in a few basic categories. For instance, what you're doing by coming to this board and trying to get an answer here is pretty much like _parasitism_. You're taking up our time, that is, it's a loss for us, a gain for you. If, on the other hand, you were willing to give some information in exchange for this one, we could reach a _mutualistic_ interaction. Both participants have a net gain. If somehow we found that we could not live without each other, that would be _obligate mutualism_, although some people call it _symbiosis_. \\nIf a rare computer virus chose your computer to spread to the world and destroyed it in the meantime, that would be _parasitoidism_. \\n\\nI'm sure you can take it from here! Please look for biological examples, these ones won't work.\\n\\nPD: I'm actually gaining two points, so what type of biotic interaction would that be?

Concentrated aqueous ammonia, Iodine, filter papers, spatula \\nMethod -  In a beaker add some crystals of iodine to some of the ammonia solution and allow to react for a couple of minutes. \\nRemove some of the precipitate to a piece of filter paper and spread evenly across paper.  Let dry in a sheltered place. \\nOnce dry simple contact will cause it to explode \\n \\nSafety - Note that this substance is an explosive.  Make sure no large lumps are left to dry on the filter paper.  Don't make too much touch power in one batch, and don't try to store it for later use.  Avoid getting these chemicals on skin or in eyes. \\nExplanation - The precipitate created is Nitrogen tri-iodide.  This compound is very unstable and is extremely sensitive to pressure, and will explode at the slightest provocation (much like grade 9 students!) \\nNotes - The ingredients in this demo are reasonably easy to get hold, even outside of the laboratory,  of so I would suggest not being too forth coming about their exact nature.

PCMCIA :- Personal Computer Memory Card International Association.\\n\\nPC card\\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\\n(Redirected from PCMCIA)\\nJump to: navigation, search\\nPC cards are cards designed to be inserted into laptop computers in order to enable extra functions.\\n\\nThey were first called PCMCIA cards as the original standards were set by the Personal Computer Memory Card International Association. This awkward initialism was jokingly expanded as "People Can't Memorize Computer Industry Acronyms" or "Personal Computer Manufacturers Can't Invent Acronyms". A later revision of the PC card is known as CardBus. The PCMCIA is also developing a new notebook peripheral specification called Newcard or ExpressCard.\\n\\nThe first PC cards (PCMCIA, with the more logical IBM meaning: Peripheral Component Microchannel Interconnect Architecture) were Type I, and supported actual Memory Cards (e.g. ATA Type I Flash Memory Cards), such as DRAM or flash memories. Type II cards added I/O support in addition to memory applications, and type III expanded on this. The interface's role as I/O for various devices has largely superseded its role as a Memory Card, but this role did spawn a generation of flash memory cards that set out to improve on the size and features of ATA Type I cards (CompactFlash, MiniCard, and SSFDC(Smartmedia)).\\n\\n \\nType II and III PC Cards. The Type III is twice the thickness of the Type II.Contents [hide]\\n1 PC card \\n2 CardBus \\n3 ExpressCard (Newcard) \\n4 External links \\n5 See also \\n \\n\\n\\n[edit]\\nPC card\\nA PC card is about the size of a credit card. There are three different sizes, varying in thickness: Type I is 3.3 mm thick, Type II is 5.0 mm thick and Type III is 10.5 mm thick. All are 85.6 mm long and 54.0 mm wide. Most notebooks used to come with two Type II slots or one Type III. With the removal of legacy ports, most notebooks now only come with one Type II card slot. Fortunately, most Type III cards were normally external hard disks that have since been replaced with USB, FireWire and now Serial ATA solutions, along with flash memory options. Memory cards such as ATA Type I flash memory cards continue to be available for the PC Card Type I.\\n\\nAs the original name suggests, the first PC cards were for memory expansion. However, the existence of a usable general standard for notebook peripherals led to all manner of devices being made available in this form. Typical devices include network cards, modems and hard disks.\\n\\nThe electrical specification for the PC card is also used for CompactFlash, so a PC Card CompactFlash adapter need only be a socket adapter.\\n\\nThe form factor is also used by the Common Interface form of Conditional Access Modules for DVB broadcasts.\\n\\n[edit]\\nCardBus\\nThe original PC Card bus was 16-bit, similar to ISA. CardBus is effectively a 32-bit, 33 MHz PCI bus, in the same physical form as the earlier cards. The notch on the left hand front of the card is slightly shallower on a CardBus card so a 32-bit card cannot be plugged into a slot that can only accept 16-bit cards. Most new slots are compatible with both CardBus and the original 16-bit PC Card devices.\\n\\nCardBus includes the bus mastering ability, which allows a controller on the bus to talk to other devices or memory without going through the CPU. Many chipsets are available for both PCI and CardBus cards, such as those that support Wi-Fi.\\n\\n[edit]\\nExpressCard (Newcard)\\n \\nExpressCards compared to the predecessor PCCard.The PCMCIA has developed a replacement for the present CardBus standard, called ExpressCard (originally codenamed Newcard), which is claimed to be faster and less complex than CardBus. The host device supports both PCI Express and USB 2.0 connectivity through the ExpressCard slot, and each card uses whichever the designer feels most appropriate to the task. The cards are hot-pluggable.\\n\\nExpressCard supports two form factors, ExpressCard/34 (34 mm wide) and Expre
This advice is probably not worth a lot, but trading currencies is just like trading stocks, with the one big exception that you are doing it on 10% margin, so your gains and losses are magnified 10x. \\n\\nA trend once started tends to continue, so look for a trend and ride it. Is the currency trading above the 50 day and 200 day moving average? Is the currency at the bottom of the bollinger band? \\n\\nBe sure to cut your losses very quickly and let your winners ride.

The best bet would be to call up whoever invited you and ask them. I've been to weddings where they wanted all the guys in tuxes, and weddings where the bride and groom were in t-shirts and jeans.\\n\\nBut I'd guess that unless you're Indian yourself, they wouldn't have a problem with you wearing European formalwear. If you can't get in contact with them, I'd say your safest bet is to go in slacks, nice shoes, a nice oxford-cloth shirt, sport coat and tie.\\n\\n**Edit**\\n\\nYou know, I'd completely missed the part where there are three days of activities. In that case, bring a jacket and suit and all that, and also some nice-looking casual clothes, like some sweaters and khaki pants and stuff. But seriously, the easiest solution is just to talk to whoever invited you.

The tapped collar or socket that receives this rod.\\n   2. A metal pin with incised threads and a broad slotted head that can be driven as a fastener by turning with a screwdriver, especially:\\n         1. A tapered and pointed wood screw.\\n         2. A cylindrical and flat-tipped machine screw.\\n\\nhttp://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=screw\\n\\nA screw is a shaft with a helical groove or thread formed on its surface. Its main uses are as a threaded fastener used to hold objects together, and as a simple machine used to translate torque into linear force. It can also be defined as an inclined plane wrapped around a shaft.\\n\\nA screw used as a threaded fastener consists of a shaft, which may be cylindrical or conical, and a head. The shaft has a helical ridge or thread formed on it. The thread is essentially an inclined plane wrapped around a shaft. The thread mates with a complementary helix in the material. The material may be manufactured with the mating helix (tapped), or the screw may create it when first driven in (a self-tapping screw). The head is specially shaped to allow a screwdriver or wrench to grip the screw when driving it in. It also stops the screw from passing right through the material being fastened and provides compression.
Chavez is Fidel's little boy toy.  Chavez sucks Fidel's thingie.  When Chavez grows up, he wants to be just like Fidel, a communist pig, and murderer.

A plant pathologist is a professional who specializes in plant health much as a physician specializes in human health or a veterinarian in animal health. Keeping plants healthy requires an understanding of the organisms and agents that cause disease as well as an understanding of how plants grow and are affected by disease. Through college courses in botany, microbiology, crop science, soil science, ecology, genetics, biochemistry, molecular biology, and physiology, students receive the necessary background for exciting careers in the interdisciplinary science of plant pathology. Most specialize by taking advanced college training for master's and doctoral degrees. Plant pathologists are employed by colleges and universities, state and federal government agencies, industrial firms, international institutes, and as private practitioners.\\nPlant Pathologists Strive To Keep\\nPlants Healthy

DO NOT DO THIS UNTIL YOU HAVE DISCONNECTED THE "INSIDE WIRING" FROM THE WIRE COMING FROM THE PHONE COMPANY . . otherwise the "ring voltage, which is about 90 volts, will FRY your modem . . a very bad deal.

HDL cholesterol is a good cholesterol therefore, you should worry about your LDL bad cholesterol.  Diet and exercise are an excellent first step to lower cholesterol.\\nYou should talk to your family doctor that will help you to choose your diet carefully and please read the information on these sites.\\n\\nLifestyle Changes\\n\\nExercise: Although not everyone can run, burning between 1,200 and 1,500 calories each week doing aerobic exercise can have dramatic results. Not only is exercising a wonderful way to keep your heart healthy, it also helps lose weight, which is an additional benefit. By losing 10 pounds of excess weight, according to Kokkinos, "That's where you see significant increases in your HDL cholesterol."\\n\\nAvoid Trans Fatty Acids: Avoid trans fatty acid containing foods such as French fries, cookies, cakes and many of the fried fast foods.\\n\\nMinimize Carbohydrates: Minimize carbohydrates by avoiding sugar, flour, potatoes and white rice. Studies prove that HDL level drops dramatically when blood sugar is spiked by carbohydrates.\\n\\nAvoid Cholesterol Foods: Minimize the food sources of cholesterol such as egg yolk, liver, kidney, brains, etc.\\n\\nStop Smoking: According to a study at Vanderbilt, within just one week of quitting smoking, HDL levels raised by seven points.\\n\\nHDL or Good Cholesterol Foods\\n\\nRed Wine: Drinking red wine is yet another option as long as it is consumed within reason. "There are antioxidants contained in red wines such as cabernet sauvignon, Merlot, and pinot noir, that help slow down the oxidation of HDL and LDL cholesterol", according to Vincent Rifici of the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School. What was shown is not that the HDL was higher than those not drinking, but that the HDL contained higher levels of several types of blood fats, thus giving the positive result. There is still a lot more research required but this could prove to be a wonderful option.\\nOrange Juice: There was one specific study conducted at the University of Western Ontario in Canada where 25 students drank orange juice every day for four week. The results were amazing. HDL was raised an astounding 21%. The individual leading this study, Elzbieta Kurowska, stated this increase might have been caused by the flavonoid in the orange juice.\\n\\nBeans: Kidney and red beans are a wonderful choice for raising HDL. These foods are low-glycemic carbohydrates that during digestion do not cause insulin spikes. Studies conducted where people ate foods rich in low-glycemic carbohydrate measure with the highest level of HDL.\\n\\nFish: Fish eaten several times a week can also be beneficial in raising HDL since it contains omega-3 fatty acids. This fish would include sardines, salmon, sea bass, herring, etc. If you do not like to eat fish, fish oil can be used as a supplement although the benefit takes much longer.\\nOlive Oil: Use oils higher in mono-unsaturated fats, such as olive oil or canola oil. Including 1-2 teaspoons of olive or canola oil with each meal would be sufficient.\\n\\nOat bran: Lowers cholesterol and LDL and raises HDL. In one study, two ounces of oat bran per day was associated with a 16% lowering of LDL and, after 3 months, an increase in HDL of as much as 15% (JAMA. 1991. 285. 1833-1839).\\n\\nOnions: Some research suggests that half of raw onion/day may raise HDL as much as 30%.\\n\\nSoy Products: A 1995 meta-analysis of 38 studies of soy confirmed that it lowers total cholesterol, LDL ("bad") cholesterol, and triglycerides, and raises HDL ("good") cholesterol.\\n\\nSoluble Fiber: Add more soluble fiber to diet. Soluble fiber is found in fruits such as apples, grapes, and citrus fruits. The fiber in these foods helps lower total cholesterol and often raises HDL levels. You need to consume at least 30 grams of fiber per day.\\n\\n\\n\\nhttp://www.loweringcholesterol.net/show/raise-hdl-cholesterol\\nhttp://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=4488
I agree partially with the post above.  You should uninstall the drivers you have by going to Add/Remove Programs in the Control Panel.  You should see something along the lines of NVidia TNT Drivers or whatnot.  Reboot the computer.  A generic windows driver will be installed so that you can still see the desktop, but it will look like crap.  Go to www.nvidia.com and download the latest drivers for your specific adapter.  Once installed, reboot the system if it doesn't reboot automatically, then when you get back to windows, right click the desktop and go to properties, click the settings tab, and reset your resolution and color depth as necessary.  You can also click the advanced button and tweak your refresh rate and other video settings here.  good luck.\\n\\nI should add that you can also uninstall the drivers using the device manager...but the add/remove programs method will help ensure that all registry entries and whatnot are removed.  This helps eliminate compatibility issues with later driver versions.

ER docs get paid slightly above average in comparison to other doctors.  However, they work shorter hours than most physicians and generally do not have to take "call" (in other words, once they are off work, they are off work).  They do not have to know everything, if you are comparing to doctors in other fields.  (All physicians have to know a little about every field, but no doctor knows everything about every field).  They just need to know how to recognize a wide variety of conditions that present in the ER, and know when to refer a patient to a specialist.\\n\\nThis is not to downplay the level of knowledge that ER docs have in comparison to other physicians.  ER docs often do well in their medical school class.  But there are other fields that are more competitive and are generally paid more (such as neurosurgery, cardiothoracic surgery, and orthopedic surgery)\\n\\nIn general, doctors working in a hospital are not paid as well as doctors in private practice.  Many, many people are treated at the hospital without health insurance (it would be unethical to turn them away).  This leaves hospitals cramped for money, so other patients' bills go up and doctors salaries go down, despite what the general public may think.\\n\\nAlso, when people discuss physician salaries, they often forget to factor in malpractice insurance, which has bankrupt and put many doctors out of business.  ...and yet so many people still want to sue doctors because they think they earn a lot of money.

I know this question was ment for non-muslims but I couldn't ignore Schneb's reply and I felt obliged to comment on what he said.\\n\\n1- I wounder where did he get the idea that churchs are not built in muslim countries?!! I've never heard about christian's attempted failed in any country to build churchs.. I guess this information means that he personally never been to a muslim counrty.\\n\\n2- Again, which UN is he talking about??!! I had to check if it were changed, as the one - and the only one that is there - Doesn't have a majorty of muslims and with records, every time the UN votes for a law or a desicion against Israel one of the 5 countries intiteled to use the veto, stopes the desicion..!! have anyone heard about UN troops in Israel to stop Israel's actions against palastanians, although Isreal troops uses weapons and bombs and distroy palastenian's house and the palastenians to defend their country which was invaded and stolen by Israel uses stones and have to bomb themselves sometimes in desperation..!! I bet not.. \\nBut everyone heared about the punishments Libya had to go through when it's leader made a desicion that the USA didn't approve, or the invasion of Iraqe under the false flag of democracy or the threatens that syria is having these days..etc.\\n\\n3- Never ever in Sudan or in any other place on earth people are killed to conver to Islam.. I think you know quite well what the christians are doing there.\\n\\nI hope I lightened some parts that were not clear and I hope your minds are open to hear the others view of the truth

< berkelium (bûr'klēəm) [from Berkeley], artificially produced radioactive chemical element; symbol Bk; at. no. 97; mass no. of most stable isotope 247; m.p. about 1,050°C; b.p. about 2,590°C; sp. gr. 14 (estimated); valence +3, +4. Berkelium is believed to be similar to the other members of the actinide series and to terbium, its homolog in the lanthanide series. It is found in group IIIb of the periodic table. The 10 isotopes of berkelium that are known are all radioactive; the element has not been found in the earth's crust. Berkelium-247, the most stable isotope (half-life about 1,400 years), is difficult to produce; berkelium-249 (half-life 314 days) is more easily produced in weighable quantities and is used in studies of berkelium chemistry. Berkelium metal exists in two crystal modifications (see allotropy) and is chemically reactive; the chloride, fluoride, sulfide, nitrate, sulfate, perchlorate, oxide, and dioxide have been produced. Berkelium was the fifth transuranium element to be synthesized. It was discovered late in 1949 by Glenn T. Seaborg, Stanley G. Thompson, and Albert Ghiorso, who produced it by bombarding americium-241 with alpha particles in the cyclotron of the Univ. of California at Berkeley. Weighable quantities of the pure element were first isolated by Thompson and B. B. Cunningham in 1958.

Contrary to common sense, the quickest way is NOT to marry her in the Philippines. It is usually faster to get her a fiancee visa, and marry when she comes to U.S. (You have to check for the specific country though).\\n\\nTo start the process, you need to submit the I-129F petition for fiancee visa to the USCIS. The form is at: http://uscis.gov/graphics/formsfee/forms/i-129f.htm\\n\\nAfter this gets processed, your fiancee can go to a U.S. embassy for an visa interview.\\n\\nMarriage visa (K3) takes up to a year to process, while fiancee visa (K1) takes much less (~4 months from petition to visa issued in Bangkok, Thailand, different in different countries).\\n\\nNote that you also have a slightly more difficult/expensive, but potentially faster option of enrolling her in a U.S. college or English study program, and getting her a student visa (F1)

The wahhabis (sect of Islam) wear their trousers above their ankles. I am not sure why but I  think they believe thats how the prophet used to wear it.\\n  Most muslims prefer to wear their trousers in a normal way with the end of the trouser NOT touching the earth but just above 1 cm from the floor.\\n  Reason1: The floor is full of garbage and dirt and they dont want to dirty their clothes. Some things are considered unpure and thus they dont wan t it to touch their clothes like urine.\\n\\n  reason 2: Respect. There is more respect to a person dressed appropriately  and not like a hooligan dragging his pants everywhere and sweeping the floor with his trousers. \\n \\n  Reason 3: Because they were their trouser at the wasit line and not below the buttocks.\\n\\n  Reason 4: Its believed that Gays during the time of Prophet Lut (Lot) used to wear their clothes dragging it on the floor (like the trousers). So muslims dont want to do it that way.\\n\\n  Reason 5: Take the reason of gateway above mine. \\n         Thank yoou Gateway.

Then take perhaps three teaspoons per day with apple cider (or any fruit juice).\\n\\nSugur and honey probably sweeten equally, but honey may have a plus.

Statistic are important to the insurance companies, because they are in the business of selling insurance to protect people or events which are at low risk.They have to know statistically the potential of how many years a person is expected to live before selling him life insurance. The same thing applies to events. If you work in a job where you might get killed, or maimed easily, they are not going to sell you any insurance too quickly. They may jack up the ins. premiums to compensate for the high risk.

72 Degrees is the temperature at which our body heat is comfortably exchanged with our surrounding environment (air).\\n\\nIn cold weather, like 30-40 degrees Farenheit, notice that the heat from our bodies is lost very quickly, leaving us feeling very cold, very fast.   The quickness of the exchange is relatively uncomfortable because our body cannot generate heat as quickly as it is losing it.\\n\\nIn warmer weather, above 72 degrees F, the opposite will happen.  Our bodies generate the same amount of heat, but we can't cool off fast enough.   That's why we start to sweat (a body cooling method), pant like dogs, and start looking for shade and cool showers..  We are trying to get rid of that "extra" heat.   \\n\\nSo 72 is the ideal temp at which our bodies are in balance with our environment.   Not too hot, but not too cold either.

Bet I know what happened to you.\\n\\nIf what you want to know is if police officers have the right to gather evidence, yes...they do.  An abnormal pulse (high or low) can be evidence of drug or alcohol use (more likely drug) and as such, the police are allowed to obtain that information.\\n\\nYou don't have the right to remain silent and not have your pulse taken because your speech isn't the issue...it's the physical state of your body that's being "questioned" and your body does not have the right to remain silent, only your mouth.\\n\\nVery educated and reasonable people are likely to disagree with me on this.  Doesn't make them right or wrong, just makes them defense lawyers most likely.\\n\\nThere is no specific statute that says you must submit to a pulse measurement (like there is for DUI, where there's a specific statute that requires you to submit to a chemical test).  However, the police do have a right to gather evidence.\\n\\nI'm sorry that you were left having to ask this question.

Plus, our educational system does not provide training for this anymore.  Be kind and respectful to the woman who arn't skilled in this.  Maybe you'll get a lawyer/accountant/CEO FRIEND who'll help in in the future.  I belive you can never have enough friends.\\n\\nGood luck and best wishes.

Money is generally what buys most elections.  Whoever has the biggest budget generally wins the election.  This goes from City Elections to National Elections whoever spend the most usually wins.  Elections are not bought per say in any other way.  There may have been things that have happened on a local scale that may not be up to par, however when this happens there is usually one party a lot stronger than the other in that area.  On a National Scale there is no way and the Electoral College keeps it that way.
The first real wave of Chinese immigrants came to California beginning in 1848 in response to the discovery of gold. They were merchants who sold their stock to the settlers and miners and then went in search for gold themselves. They wrote home to share their experiences and by 1851 there were almost 25,000 Chinese, called "Celestials" for the Celestial Empire of China, on the West Coast. These immigrants were almost all from the province of Kwangtung in southern China, traveling through the harbors of Canton and Hong Kong. In rural China of the time, the purpose of life was the well-being of the family group. Many families sold possessions and/or borrowed in order to send one young man to America to make a fortune, not for himself, but to send back home to his family. The idea was to get as rich as possible as quickly as possible and then to return home. Other miners resented their lack of interest in becoming naturalized and by 1852 they were being driven from the mines. Still seeking their fortunes, many turned to jobs which the miners did not want to perform for themselves, such as cooking and laundry. By 1860 many had returned home. Then in 1862 the Union Pacific and Central Pacific cross-continental rail line began construction. A new wave of immigrants came from China through the Chinese Six Companies, organized into crews with their passage prepaid and then deducted from their monthly wages. When the railroad was completed in 1869, some Chinese returned home but for each one who returned, two more arrived. Some 123,000 came in the 1870's. The economy and political situation was against them. The Gold Rush was over and most people had failed to make their fortune. The railroad was completed, the major swamplands had been filled, and industry did not need the thousands of unskilled laborers. An agitator named Dennis Kearney organized what became the Workingman's Party in an effort to drive the immigrants away and protect American jobs. Harrassment escalated until the Exclusion Act of 1882 which was intended to prohibit the entry of Chinese laborers for ten years. Many Chinese left. Those who remained responded by moving away from the West Coast and establishing neighborhoods of their own whereever they went. Family life was the exception in these communities since most immigrants were single young men, or if married, had left their wives at home, expecting only a short stay in America. The Exclusion Laws made it almost impossible to bring family into the country. The Chinese distrusted American institutions and formed their own family associations, district organizations, and halls. Tongs were first founded as social clubs, but some, especially in San Francisco between 1880 and 1900 became involved in crime and vice. The Exclusion Laws were not repealed until the United States and China allied during World War I. Many of the original immigrants had either returned home or died, but enough remained to cause another wave of immigration as families were finally allowed to reunite. Then in 1949 the Communist takeover of mainland China caused a new wave of immigration. Unlike previous waves, many were from the educated and upper levels of society, and they brought entire families at once. This trend of educated, skilled immigrants and immigrants of all ages has continued into today.

Most diseases are spread through contact or close proximity because the causative bacteria or viruses are airborne; i.e., they can be expelled from the nose and mouth of the infected person and inhaled by anyone in the vicinity. \\n\\nCancer is a disease of cells. It is an abnormal growth of cells which tend to proliferate in an uncontrolled way and, in some cases, to metastasize (spread). \\n\\nCancer is also called malignancy. A cancerous growth or tumor is sometimes referred to as a malignant growth or tumor. A non-malignant growth or tumor is referred to as benign. Benign tumors are not cancer. \\n\\nCancer is not one disease. It is a group of more than 100 different and distinctive diseases. Cancer is NOT contagious.\\nhttp://www.answers.com/cancer?gwp=12&method=2
Yeah it's tough dealing with those people. \\nWhenever they quote Levetawhatever, I just let them know that it also says that wearing clothing of a cotton blend is also something spoken against in that chapter, then they go running back to their Coach purses and adorable little sports jerseys that they love so much. \\nSome things are messed up in the Bible, go figure, it's the word of MAN. We need to pick and choose what is right (since, well, Christians already do), and homosexuality has been shown to be innate (and shown also in other species) rather than a choice. SO a better question may be: Why would God make homosexuals? Just to send them to Hell? I think not.

this is not rare to occur...coz it takes time for sensation to recover and so the patient my not even realise that he has bit his tongue, cheeks or lips...\\nthe only possible precaution is that the docs need to inform the patient to consciously avoid doing that or ask the relatives to take care wen it is a child patient. so it also depends on the age of your niece.\\nwhile inserting the tube, they shud hold the tongue and retract the lips and cheeks in such a case.\\nbut still with all such precautions, soft tissue bites are quite common after oral surgeries especially under local anaesthesia.

Green is NOT the main color to power phot synthesis, in facts it bounces it back and doesnt even use green. The plant is green because green light is getting bounced back.

Actually it isn't legally or humanly wrong to show your real emotions in public. But it's just the way our society works. Think about it, if you showed your real emotions at work, and still managed to complete your job, people would still term you as 'un-professional', because they think that that sort of behaviour would disrupt everyone else's performance (which is probably true). You see, human beings are taught to handle personal matters discretely, and if you suddenly expressed your strong emotions to a person you'd probably throw him/her offguard. And of course the real key to having successful friendships and acquaintances with people is that you can control your emotions around them. You may feel angry, but you don't directly hit out at them, right? But if you're overjoyed, well then, I guess there isn't any harm in expressing yourself. \\nRemember, it isn't wrong to show your emotions (and it's good to learn to control them), it's just that people are not used to it.

Hon, I have been there several times and I know it hurts. Time is the best healer. First try to get your mind on something else, anything so that your mind isn't on the person. Go to the movie place and browse for a good movie (a comedy is always good), go to the library, or out shopping and browsing.  Just get out and do something...anything to avoid sitting at home and thinking about the person.  Have a good cry, listen to sad love songs and then get out of the house and do some things.  Try spending extra time with friends or your kids(if you have them), or even at work.  You will find as each day goes by the pain fades.  You may still love the person, but when you think of them again it won't hurt anymore as time goes by.

That depends on the channel's type? For example if it is a music channel you can advertise it in music magazines and sites.\\n\\nYou need to disclosure more information about your TV channel to get better answers…\\n\\nGenerally, I suggest you advertise it in newspapers, magazines, and billboards (not radio).\\nIf TV channels in your region or country are plenty you may need to segment the market you are targeting at, so that you are differentiated (creating advantages and adding value for your clients).\\n\\nDo market research… See how your idea sounds to people? Listen to what they need… you may get proposals on what type of channel is missing in your town or what type of channel they want.\\n\\nBear in mind that a TV channel is a big investment and you need to carefully plan all your steps and actions.

It depends if you are playing solo or with a piano accompaniment. If you are playing solo, you would use a tuning fork (440 Hz)to tune your "A" string. Then, you would use your "A" string as a reference to tune the other strings. The strings on a violin are "G" "D" "A" and "E". Basically, the pitch of the strings is in ascending fifth. You want to try to tune to a perfect fifth: ie. "G and D" "D and A" and "A and E". \\n\\nWith a piano accompaniment, you tune to the A above the middle C on the piano. And use that as your reference.

A ball signed by Willie Mays alone will run around $250-$300 depending on the quality.  A ball signed by Bobby Bonds alone will run around $200, again varying by quality.\\n\\nA ball signed by both, and then more will be worth much more.  Especially if it has any established providence (You can authenticate the signatures and any good, real stories behind it).\\n\\nAs for being a WS ball, it is not one.  The four players you named only played together for 2.5 seasons, 1968 (Bond's rookie season) - July 1970 (when McCormick was traded).  Depending on other players on the ball, you may be able to narrow it down to the exact season.  They did not make the pennant in any of those seasons.  If you want to cross-check some other names, go to http://www.baseball-reference.com and go to the SFG page and look at those years for the rosters.\\n\\nHowever, the ball still has some classic HOF worthy signatures, and if authentic, could be worth some.  Value for an item like that is only what someone is willing to pay for it at the moment you want to sell it, and a reliable collectables shop should be able to get you a relatively good value, and help you get it sold if you want that.
I do know that it causes eye strain.  I hear many people say that they wear glasses now because they have worked with computers for so long but, if the computers were the cause I don't know.

Since you're Pinoy and I'm American, I don't know how much I'm going to be able to help you on this one. America's cheaper than Japan for a lot of things. Japan still has the Gaijin thing going on, but America's got a real xenophobic vibe at present, too. Japan's a great place to experience. If you're sure you have enough to cover food and lodging the whole time you're there, you'd really enjoy it. America's so much bigger. I guess if you were talking about living forever, might think about the US since there's much more room.
First thing is first... did the paper rip? There may be a small peice that is caught inside causing a jam. Second, is there a feed button? Might try this to see if it's the printer itself (which my guess is that it is). Third, usually when you turn a printer off and then back on depending on brand, there will be a test print, if this works, you know it isn't the printer. Fourth, unplug it for about 10 minutes and then plug it back in... sometimes it is the most simple things..lol. Fifth, if this doesn't work, uninstall the printer from your computer, reinstall. Don't have the disk? Don't worry! You can almost ALWAYS go to the website of the manufacturer and download the drivers for your particular model (same thing a disk would do). Hopefully one of these things work, and be safe on your travels back to wherever you live on Friday!!
this is a girl's perspective:start off by finding the courage to ask her out and take her somewhere nice but not too "couply",if you see what i mean..don't be too agressive cause tou may scare her off..then you can tell her how you feel and make it sound really genuine but do not make her feel sorry for you coz you are hopelessly in love with her or something..and if she's worth your love she will accept..definately..good luck man!
It's not the size of the ship but the motion of the ocean...I know corny but size isn't everything.  I have had partners that were small but were amazing in bed.  If sex is just about penetration to you then you need more practice.  Pleasing your girl is more about the foreplay than just sticking it in.  You should concetrate more on touching her with your hands and lips first.  Explore her with your hands and fingers before you go for it.  If you still feel like she isn't being pleased, ask.  If you are having sex, you should be able to talk about it with her.  Ask her what she likes.

Most people have experienced the dreaded ice cream headache at some point. You are minding your own business on a hot summer day, eating something like an ice cream cone, a milk shake, a Slurpee, a snow cone... Then, suddenly you are hit with the most excruciating headache! Fortunately it only lasts about 30 seconds. \\n\\nSo where does this headache come from? \\n\\nI have not seen a better answer to the question than in this article by Joseph Hulihan. It's a little technical, but it contains some great information. Here's a summary: When something cold touches the roof of your mouth on a hot day, it triggers a cold headache. The cause is a dilation of blood vessels in the head. The dilation may be caused by a nerve center located above the roof of your mouth -- when this nerve center gets cold, it seems to over-react and tries to heat your brain. \\n\\nTherefore, the easy way to avoid "brain freeze" is to keep cold things away from the roof of your mouth!

Yes there is.  Not only is the AGP bus technology more advanced than PCI, the video cards available for AGP slots are generally alot faster/better than ones available for PCI slots.  For example, in the previous generation of video cards the most powerful nvidia PCI video card was the FX5500 while the most powerful nvidia AGP video card was the FX5900 (higher model numbers are better than lower ones).  With the current generation of video cards, I don't even think any PCI versions are available.
Hi, I don't know if you know and accept karma theory. If your being good and things are happening bad to you then just take it as all the consequences of your previous bad deeds are being washed away, and it will make you a better human being. Also it gives a nice opportunity to fine tune your self and see if you are really good and correct even the minutest of defects in you. Yes i understand what you say, i have been through such feelings, but i am sure in the end, if your good then for sure if you look at a bigger picture, you will definitely realize that whatever is happening is happening for your own good, but that may be a result in the long run.\\nbest regards

The blue color of the sky is due to Rayleigh scattering. As light moves through the atmosphere, most of the longer wavelengths pass straight through. Little of the red, orange and yellow light is affected by the air.\\n\\nHowever, much of the shorter wavelength light is absorbed by the gas molecules. The absorbed blue light is then radiated in different directions. It gets scattered all around the sky. Whichever direction you look, some of this scattered blue light reaches you. Since you see the blue light from everywhere overhead, the sky looks blue.
When an object (or disturbance) moves faster than the information about it can be propagated into the surrounding fluid, fluid near the disturbance cannot react or "get out of the way" before the disturbance arrives. In a shock wave the properties of the fluid(density, pressure, temperature, velocity, Mach number) change almost instantaneously. Measurements of the thickness of shock waves have resulted in values approximately one order of magnitude greater than the mean free path of the gas investigated.\\n\\nShock waves are not sound waves; a shock wave takes the form of a very sharp change in the gas properties on the order of micro-meters in thickness. Shock waves in air are heard as a loud "crack" or "snap" noise. Over time a shock wave can change from a nonlinear wave into a linear wave, degenerating into a conventional sound wave as it heats the air and loses energy. The sound wave is heard as the familiar "thud" or "thump" of a sonic boom, commonly created by the supersonic flight of aircraft.\\n\\nEveryone's familiar with the sonic boom from passing jets - that's a shock wave - but so is a balloon popping!  Interesting, huh?

The last 15 years? Well, that would either be Michael Jackson or Madonna. Both created their own unique sound and had many other artists in the past several years come out and try to be like them.

While Michael has lost most of his American following due to his legal issues, he is still one of the top recording artists in European and Asian countries. Madonna, on the other hand, continues to re-invent herself with each new album. This is shown in her most recent release of "Confessions on a Dance Floor". She's physically in the best shape she's been in for several years and her sound still makes people get up and move.

Free will throws God's plan out of whack.  I.e. Adam and Eve eating the fruit wasn't in God's perfect will, so God went to plan B
The purpose of the Virgin Birth story in regards to Jesus was to give him a miracle birth like all the other dying/saving  man/gods of the ancient world. Many of them were born of a human mother and a god for a father. Even Hercules had a human mother, Elcmene, and Zeus for a father. Dionysus had Semele for his human mother and, again, Zeus for his father, and the death of Dionysus was seen by his follers as dying for their sins.\\n\\nWhat everyone forgets is that IF Jesus was born of a virgin, then he cannot trace his lineage back to King David, and he therefore could not have been the Messiah! Some might say that this was to prevent him from being a descendant of Jehoikim, Jeconiah, or Shealtiel whose descendants, like Joseph, were cursed and would preclude a descendant of them from being the Messiah. But you cant have your cake and eat it too. He cant get the benefit from being a descendant of David through Joseph, without the curse that comes from being a descendant of those three, if he is to claim being from the House of David through Joseph.\\n\\nFurthermore, the Bible makes it clear that the Real Messiah is not adopted into the Davidic Line, but must be a direct bloodline descendant through his own human father back to King David, through Solomon.\\n\\nAnd if one were to actually pick up the Bible and read it, one would see that every single genealogy in the Bible traces the lineage through the father. If a mother is mentioned it is because she was famous, but the lineage still goes through her husband and not her. This is also true in the Christians' New Testament, where both Matthew and Luke trace Jesus's lineage through the males. This means that even if Mary was a descendant of King David, it would not matter because one's lineage is traced through one's father, not one's mother.

I found out that my fiance cheated on me and I was absolutely DESTROYED. I had a party at my house one night and we were all drunk. A couple of the guys I work with stayed over because they couldn't drive home. While I was sleeping, one of them talked my fiance into messing around with him. It was the worst feeling I have ever felt in my life. I felt betrayed, hurt... I can't even think of any words that can do my pain any justice. My fiance told me about it because she felt so bad when she realized what she did. I am a good enough guy and I loved her enough that I forgave her for it. After all, she was drunk and could not be held completely responsible. I could not be without her, i know now. Most people would not have done the same thing that I did. Being cheated on is the WORST FEELING IN THE ENTIRE WORLD. If you are thinking about it, DON'T DO IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Because the product keys are encrypted, you cannot simply go into the registry and retrieve it like you could in earlier versions of Windows. You will need a utility program to extract the product id from your registry. One such tool is the Magical Jelly Bean Keyfinder. Another is the Belarc Advisor. I am certain there are others on the market as well but we will focus on the use of these two for the purposes of this article.\\n\\n    * The Magical Jelly Bean Keyfinder is a freeware utility that retrieves your Product Key (CD key) used to install Windows or Office from your registry. It has the options to copy the key to clipboard, save it to a text file, or print it for safekeeping. It works on Windows 95, 98, ME, NT4, 2000, XP, Server 2003, Office 97 and Office XP. Unfortunately, it does not appear to support Office 2000.\\n\\n      The Magical Jelly Bean Keyfinder is amazingly simple to use. The file itself, keyfinder.exe, is small—only 257 KB. There is no installation program. Just run the program, either from the command line or by double-clicking it from the folder you downloaded it to. When you do, your product key will appear as shown. (I changed my product key in this image for security reasons.)\\n    * The Belarc Advisor is a freeware utility that builds a detailed profile of your installed software and hardware and then displays the results in your Web browser. None of this information is sent to the internet. It is all stored privately on your computer.\\n\\n      The information displayed includes, but is not limited to:\\n         1. Operating System type and build\\n         2. Motherboard brand and serial number\\n         3. Installed drives, CD and fixed, including brand and capacity\\n         4. Installed Microsoft hotfixes\\n         5. Installed Microsoft software licenses and some keys\\n         6. List of all installed software \\n\\nNOTE: It should be noted that I have received at least one report of the Magical Jelly Bean Keyfinder returning an incorrect key. I have never had that happen to me and I have used it many time to recover keys from the registries of clients computers. The Belarc Advisor does have this footnote on its results page regarding Windows keys: "This may be the manufacturer's factory installed product key rather than yours." I believe this may be the cause of the MJB error as well.\\n\\nThat’s all there is to it. Once you recover the key, write down the number and then you can reinstall your software, or place the it in a database where you won’t lose it.\\n\\nEDIT: 10:38AM, March 10, 2006\\n\\nYou may want to try Insaneware Keyfinder:\\n\\nhttp://www.insaneware.com/

1. At the neuromuscular juncture, ACh released by the synaptic terminal binds to receptors on the sarcolemma.\\n\\n2. The resulting change in the transmembrane potential of the muscle fiber leads to the production of action petential that spreads across the entire surface of the muscle fiber and along the T tubules.\\n\\n3.The sarcoplasmic reticulum releases stored calcium ions, increasing the calcium concentration of the sarcoplasm in and around the sarcomeres.\\n\\n4. Calcium ions bind to triponin, producing a change in the orientation of the troponin-tropomyosin complex that exposes active sites on the thin filaments (actin).  Cross-bridges form when myosin heads bind to the active sites on F actin.\\n\\n5. The contraction begins as repeated cycles of cross-bridge binding, pivoting, and detatchment occur, powered by the hydrolysis of ATP.  These events produce filament sliding, and the muscle fiber shortens.
Why is it called war on terror. Was it not called war on terrorism just a few months back ? I think that war is built on a lie. The lie about WMD being ready and able to be a threat to the US. I can only say that this was a picked fight and later grab for any reason to get it started. When it got started it was a point of no return. \\nSaddam is and was a crook , he have been that in the  00s in the 90s and in the 80s . Even in the 70s. \\n\\nHere comes the part I dont understand. Why arming Saddam in the 80s like US did. They knew he was a crook but that didnt matter for Reagan or Bush sr. Who cared about the Iraqi peolpe back then supporting there oppressor. \\n\\nIn a way by being in Iraq at the moment and hopefully building something that will last will bring some ease on US as a nation that before supported the Iraqi peoples opressor. Like clean up there own mess in a way. \\n\\nBefore people begin jump me and call me anti american I will point out that US wasnt the only nation that supported Saddam in the 80s. But since the question specific relate to US and Iraq I have limited the answer or more correctly my point view in the issue.
One of the best ways to find out if someone truly loves you, is to think about if he or she is truly looking out for your best interest; nowadays, love is totally misinterpreted. Look at his actions and what he says and think, "Are those actions and words motivated by him looking out for me, or for his own interests."\\nHope this helps, ....from a guy's point of view, by the way. As a guy, I know that many...no....the majority of guys are in relationships for there own personal gain..
It reduces the demand on our natural resources, saves valuable landfill space, and creates opportunities for new industries. \\n\\nIf we don’t recycle, we will eventually run out of space for all of our trash.  What will we do with it then? \\n\\nIt saves money. Almost every trash disposal bill can be reduced by recycling more. For our entire community, this is an important economic consideration. Trash disposal costs are a drain on our local purchasing power, while recycling can generate new revenue from sales of recyclable commodities.\\n\\nIt saves resources and energy.\\nFor every ton of paper we recycle, about 17 trees are saved that would otherwise be cut for paper pulp. Other resources that are saved include 7,000 gallons of water, 380 gallons of oil, and enough electricity to power the average home for six months.\\n\\nBy recycling a single aluminum can, enough electricity is saved to run a TV for six hours.\\n\\nBy recycling a single glass bottle, enough electricity is saved to operate a 100 watt light bulb for 4 hours.\\n\\nIt saves landfill space. A landfill is space which we have destroyed for almost any future use except storing garbage. The less trash we put in landfills, the more land is available for future generations.\\n\\nHelps to prevent pollution: Almost all manufacturing processes use water and release wastewater and air emissions into the environment. Reducing and reusing products cuts down on manufacturing pollution, just as the use of recycled instead of virgin materials prevents pollution in industrial processes. \\n\\nIt's the law. To protect our environment, the State of California requires each city and county to recycle 50% of all solid waste by the year 2000. Reaching this goal requires the support of all households and businesses. For more information, call the Mendocino Solid Waste Management Authority at 468-9710.\\n\\nDid you know?\\nThe average U.S. household discards each year 13,000 paper items, 500 aluminum cans, 500 glass bottles, and 1,800 plastic items.\\n\\nEvery week, more than 500,000 trees are used to produce the two-thirds of newspapers that are never recycled.\\n\\nAmerican consumers and industry throw away enough aluminum to rebuild our entire commercial airfleet every 3 months.\\n\\nTo make a 6-foot long park bench out of recycled plastics ("plastic lumber"), it takes 1,050 recycled milk jugs.\\n\\nThere's lots of good reasons to recycle!! Do YOU recycle?
IMO this is one of the ways our body is built to be adaptive.  For people who are exposed to a constant need to lift heavy objects, the body sends a message to the bone cells to add more bone to handle the extra demand that they will need.\\n\\nAnother example of this adaptivity is modifying the metabolism to use fewer calories when experiencing a famine and keeping this change after the famine ends.\\n\\nUnfortunately for us modern folk who never experience famine unless we are dieting, this makes losing weight even harder!

The earliest I have heard it used was by Bob Hope in describing the buxom movie stars that toured with him during World War II as he and his troupe visited the U.

Government is the ordering of the unwilling by the incompetent for the ungrateful.\\n\\nActually, the purpose of government is to do that which is socially necssary but which all people cannot or will not do willingly.  I mean, if you had to go around for a collection box to pave a road, would everyone who drives on that road contribute?  How many people would chip in on a voluntary basis to build a prison?  Would the majority agree that police should be stopping speeders?  Everybody likes to speed.\\n\\nAnd, of course, government is the legitimator of force.  Only with government permission may one adult use physical force against another.  And that's the way it should be.

The blue color of the sky is due to Rayleigh scattering. As light moves through the atmosphere, most of the longer wavelengths pass straight through. Little of the red, orange and yellow light is affected by the air. \\n\\nHowever, much of the shorter wavelength light is absorbed by the gas molecules. The absorbed blue light is then radiated in different directions. It gets scattered all around the sky. Whichever direction you look, some of this scattered blue light reaches you. Since you see the blue light from everywhere overhead, the sky looks blue. \\nAs you look closer to the horizon, the sky appears much paler in color. To reach you, the scattered blue light must pass through more air. Some of it gets scattered away again in other directions. Less blue light reaches your eyes. The color of the sky near the horizon appears paler or white.

I don't believe there is a definite answer, and I feel that many of the arguments made both for and against the war are inaccurate.  First, the argument that we are there for oil.  If this were the case, you would have seen American oil companies moving in, special trade agreements, and lower oil and gas prices.  This has not happened, so I doubt this is the case.  Second, that Bush was lying.  Bush didn't lie about the wmd's because he didn't make up the intelligence.  He believed the information given to him by people who also believed in it, and just because it was incorrect does not mean he lied.  \\nHowever, I believe wholeheartedly that we should still be there, and continue to be there until things have stabilized.  We made a promise to those people, and we must keep it.  I guarantee you, if this works out, thirty years down the road when this is in the history books, we will be the good guys.  In fact, the majority of the Iraqi people love what we are doing.  So, in conclusion, while me may not have been "right" to invade, we are doing the people of Iraq a great service by actually giving them a chance to be free.

I'm guessing you didn't have too close a relationship with your father to be able to see his wife sexually let alone have sex with her. Stay away from her and keep letting your Dad know how sorry you are, I don't think this is something that will smooth over quickly but you may regain part of your relationship with your father with some time, depending on how close the two of you are. Stay away from that woman no matter what happens! Good Luck

A Nonlinear Program (NLP) is a problem that can be put into the form\\n\\n    minimize   F(x)\\n\\n    subject to gi(x)  = 0    for i = 1, ..., m1       where m1 >= 0\\n               hj(x) >= 0    for j = m1+1, ..., m     where m >= m1\\n\\nThat is, there is one scalar-valued function F, of several variables (x here is a vector), that we seek to minimize subject (perhaps) to one or more other such functions that serve to limit or define the values of these variables. F is called the "objective function", while the various other functions are called the "constraints". (If maximization is sought, it is trivial to do so, by multiplying F by -1.)\\n\\nBecause NLP is a difficult field, researchers have identified special cases for study. A particularly well studied case is the one where all the constraints g and h are linear. The name for such a problem, unsurprisingly, is "linearly constrained optimization". If, as well, the objective function is quadratic at most, this problem is called Quadratic Programming (QP). An even more special case of great importance is where the objective function and the constraints are entirely linear; this is called Linear Programming (LP) and is discussed in a separate FAQ list. Another important special case, called unconstrained optimization, is where there are no constraints at all.\\n\\nOne of the greatest challenges in NLP is that some problems exhibit "local optima"; that is, spurious solutions that merely satisfy the requirements on the derivatives of the functions. Think of a near-sighted mountain climber in a terrain with multiple peaks, and you'll see the difficulty posed for an algorithm that tries to move from point to point only by climbing uphill. Algorithms that propose to overcome this difficulty are termed "Global Optimization".\\n\\nThe word "Programming" is used here in the sense of "planning"; the necessary relationship to computer programming was incidental to the choice of name. Hence the phrase "NLP program" to refer to a piece of software is not a redundancy, although I tend to use the term "code" instead of "program" to avoid the possible ambiguity. \\n\\nThe sites below are quite good. If you want a career in Operations Research or Retailing Management, NLP is a gr8 plus to learn

I fast and detox once a month and it's great for your mind as well as your body.  If you don't work on a Sunday I think it would be a good day to start.  I start the day with a long bath and throughout the day I try to keep active.  As I'm not a big eater it doesn't bother me if I don't eat food for a week.  For the rest of the week I drink water, fresh juice and herbal teas.  Water helps to break down body fat and get rid of access waste so by the end of the week I have lost about 1/2 stone and feel so much lighter.  If a week seems like a long time to go without anything to eat have raw vegetables.  This is what I have when coming of a detoxing fast.  I also find the hardest thing to eat and drink after is dairy produces.  They seem to have a heavier taste when you haven't had them for a while.  Not only will you loose both weight and toxins from your body you will also feel more happier and alert. \\n\\nDepending on your age, weight and lifestyle if you have any concerns maybe a visit to your doctor would be advisable if you had any real concerns.

I think that the problem a lot of people have with Christianity is that a large segment of Christians try to translate the Bible literally.  This only leads to kind of a joking atmosphere when discussing certain aspects of Christianity and makes it very hard to take the good parts as, well, good parts.  Since some of these people, who believe so completely that the literal translations are the correction translations, feel compelled to constantly, repeatedly and forcefully enlighten others as to their beliefs, it burns bridges for everyone who falls under the banner of Christianity.  Consequently, those who see the teachings of the Bible as simple lessons of morals are not able to spread that understanding because most listeners have become cynical whenever they are preached at.  It is a shame that all that people hear and see is the inherent holes yelled at them by sidewalk prophets and not the plain belief that the Bible is a list of good ideas set to a classic storied theme.  So, just try to take the Bible as a good story with some ideas and morals to try to live by.  Anything more and you will become disenfranchised when something is proven to be incorrect or unbelievable.

Go (the game, not the verb) is the ultimate board game. I used to be a big chess fan, but since I (re)discovered Go, chess seems like a waste of time.\\n\\nGo is a truly amazing game: it's one of the oldest in the world (about 4000 years), it's VERY easy to learn (takes less than 30 minutes), but it takes many years to reach a high level,\\nand here's the kicker:\\n\\nAny moderately good amateur player (which you can become in about 1 or 2 years) can easily beat the best Go programs running on the fastest computers in the world!!\\nSo it is one area where the human brain totally humiliates all the computing power in the world and the best algorithms that people designed so far!\\n\\nGo also has a handicap system, allowing players with different strenth to play against each other with equal chances. And most of all, Go is beautiful :)\\n\\nHere are some sites about Go:\\nhttp://www.kiseido.com/\\nhttp://senseis.xmp.net/\\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(board_game)

Well it doesn't worsen your condition, although it may irritate your scalp (and the flakes may fall on your clothes making it appear worse).\\n\\nCommon dandruff is thought to be caused by a fungus, so use of a medicated shampoo (such as Neutrogena T/Gel or Nizoral) will help. Use it every day until the flakes are under control, and then once or twice a week afterward to keep it under control.
Welcome to the Sport of English Riding.  Are you showing Hunter rail classes or Hunter/Jumper?  If you are showing Hunter, you want to wear a Hunt Coat that accentuates you and the horse.  If you are riding a dark horse, then possibly wearing a light jacket will look nice, tweed color. If you are riding a lighter horse then go with the darker jackets (navy blue or Black)  Tan breeches are typical.  Tall field boots are the norm for adults. White shirt is typical, although I have seen the colored shirts shown as well.  If you are showing in schooling shows, not a rated show, you can show without a coat. Tan breeches, colored shirt, and half chaps are okay.  Check with the club you are showing, they typically post the riding attire requirements.  Show clothes are expensive.  Check Ebay, there are always good deals there.  If this is Dressage, everything changes.  You have to have a Dressage Coat, black, white breeches, black gloves, tall field boots or dress boots, and Hunt helmet with the bow on the back.  I forgot to answer regarding helmet for hunter, need to have Hunt helmet velvet cover.  Can be Troxel or similar with a velvet cover that is removeable.  I hope this helps.

My only suggestion to resolve this matter for "free" is to go down to your local library. They should have all of the newspapers on microfilche or microfilm and from there you could begin searching for your fathers death notice or any info that was published. Once you figure the exact date and time then you can attempt to contact your local city hall or county clerks office and request the death certificate. It is all part of public record. If there were any criminal charges you can also check with the court system in your area and they will guide you in the right direction.

A Theory of Everything (TOE) is the name given to attempts to view the four fundamental forces of the universe: \\n\\n1. gravity\\n2. electromagnetism\\n3. the weak force (responsible for radioactivity)\\n4. the strong force (keeps the atomic nucleus together) \\n\\nas just different aspects of the same thing. This was worked on by Einstein towards the end of his life for quite a few years. So far, forces 1&2 have been reliably unified (as electromagnetism was the theory resulting when electricity and magnetism were unified). The unification of 1,2 and 3 looks like it might have been done, but has not yet been verified completely. There are many theories to unify all 4 of the forces, including the recent varieties of string theory, but no one knows how to check these.
WELL OBVIOUSLY ITS ENGLAND, BUT HERE IS SOME INFOMATION ABOUT ITS ORGIN:\\n\\nThe Laws of the Game are based on efforts made in the mid-19th century to standardise the rules of the widely varying games of football played at the independent schools of England. The first set of rules resembling the modern game were produced at Trinity College, Cambridge in 1848, at a meeting attended by representatives from Eton, Harrow, Rugby, Winchester and Shrewsbury, but they were far from universally adopted. During the 1850s, many clubs were formed, thoughout the English-speaking world, independent of schools or universities, to play various forms of football. Some came up with their own distinct codes of rules, most notably the Sheffield Football Club (formed by former pupils from Harrow) in 1857, which led to formation of a Sheffield FA in 1867. In 1862, J.C. Thring of Uppingham School also devised an influential set of rules.

Did he check the TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone), which is a pituitary hormone which stimulates the thyroid??  The usual cause of hyperthyroidism is a diffuse enlargement of the thyroid gland.  You have high thyroxin (T4) and low TSH (the high T4 causes feedback inhibition on the anterior pituitary gland, and lowers the TSH).  In fact, the TSH is often a more sensitive test for Graves disease than the T4. Sometimes your T4 will be in normal range, but if you got a low TSH, you probably got hyperthyroidism.  Also, your eyes may look a little bulging. Rapid pulse, heat intolerance, fine tremor, losing weight, sure---irregular periods, all can be signs of hyperthyroidism.  You expect the person to be a little manic and skinny, but there is an "apathetic hyperthyroidism", where they get kind of burned out on the high hormone, and start to put weight back on and look depressed.  Of course, if you got a very high TSH and a high T4, then it means you got a little tumour of your anterior pituitary gland causing the high thyroid, and sometimes other hormone imbalances as well.\\n\\nAn endocrinologist is the expert.  There are lots of subtleties to this I'm not totally aware of.  But i'm thinking you might still have hyperthyroidism and need treatment with PTL (propylthiouracil) at least, if not radioactive iodine ablation therapy or surgical subtotal thyroidectomy, which are the treatment options.  I would get a thyroid scan.  That tells you more.  Otherwise, see an endocrinologist.  Also, if you have been on any meds or drugs, this can effect your thyroid function.  Lithium, used to treat bipolar disorder, certainly messes with the thyroid.  I believe depression can affect it as well.  So can alcoholism.

There was not an authentic Medieval Code of Chivalry as such - it was a moral system which went beyond rules of combat and introduced the concept of Chivalrous conduct - qualities idealized by knighthood, such as bravery, courtesy, honor, and gallantry toward women. The Medieval Code of Chivalry was understood by all but a Code of Chivalry was documented in 'The Song of Roland' in the early Medieval period of William the Conqueror. The 'Song of Roland' describes the 8th century Knights and battles of the Emperor Charlemagne and has been described as Charlemagne's Code of Chivalry. The idea of the Code of Chivalry were emphasised by the oaths that were sworn in Knighthood ceremonies. These sacred oaths were combined with the ideals of chivalry and with strict rules of etiquette and conduct. The idea and ideals of a Medieval Code of Chivalry was publicised in the poems, ballads, writings and literary works of Medieval authors. The myths of Arthurian Legends featuring King Arthur, Camelot and the Knights of the Round Table further strengthen the idea of a Medieval Code of Chivalry. The Arthurian legend revolves around the Code of Chivalry followed by the Knights of the Round Table - Honour, Honesty, Valour and Loyalty.\\n\\nThe Song of Roland - Charlemagne's Code of Chivalry\\nA Code of Chivalry was documented in 'The Song of Roland' in the early 11th Century Medieval period of William the Conqueror. The 'Song of Roland' describes the 8th Century Knights and battles of the Emperor Charlemagne and has been described as Charlemagne's Code of Chivalry. The duties of a Knight were described as follows:\\n\\nTo fear God and maintain His Church\\nTo serve the liege lord in valour and faith\\nTo protect the weak and defenceless\\nTo give succour to widows and orphans\\nTo refrain from the wanton giving of offence\\nTo live by honour and for glory\\nTo despise pecuniary reward\\nTo fight for the welfare of all\\nTo obey those placed in authority\\nTo guard the honour of fellow knights\\nTo eschew unfairness, meanness and deceit\\nTo keep faith\\nAt all times to speak the truth\\nTo persevere to the end in any enterprise begun\\nTo respect the honour of women\\nNever to refuse a challenge from an equal\\nNever to turn the back upon a foe.\\n\\nMedieval Code of Chivalry - the Rules of Courtly Love\\nThe following rules of Courtly Love were written by the 12th Century Frenchman, Andreas Capellanus. These 31 rules describe the pure romance of love but also describe love for another man's wife. This 'Courtly Love' is illustrated in the fictional story of Sir Lancelot and Queen Guinevere. But these rules of Courtly Love led to the downfall and execution of Queen Anne Boleyn, the wife of King Henry VIII - who lived his entire life putting in to practise the 'Rules of Courtly Love'.\\n\\nI. Marriage is no real excuse for not loving.\\nII. He who is not jealous cannot love.\\nIII. No one can be bound by a double love.\\nIV. It is well known that love is always increasing or decreasing.\\nV. That which a lover takes against the will of his beloved has no relish.\\nVI. Boys do not love until they arrive at the age of maturity.\\nVII. When one lover dies, a widowhood of two years is required of the survivor.\\nVIII. No one should be deprived of love without the very best of reasons.\\nIX. No one can love unless he is impelled by the persuasion of love.\\nX. Love is always a stranger in the home of avarice.\\nXI.

The name India IPA: /'ɪndiə/, is derived from the Old Persian version of Sindhu, the historic local appellation for the river Indus; see Origin of India's name. The Constitution of India and general usage also recognises Bharat (Hindi: भारत IPA: /bɦaːrət̪/  listen?), which is derived from the Sanskrit name of an ancient Hindu king, whose story is to be found in the Mahabharata, as an official name of equal status. A third name, Hindustan (Hindi: हिन्दुस्तान IPA: /ɦɪn̪d̪ʊst̪aːn/)  listen?, or Land of the Hindus in Persian, has been used since the twelfth century, though its contemporary use is unevenly applied due to domestic disputes over its representiveness as a national signifier.

Interesting story. \\n\\nWas there a question in there somewhere?
Democritus first suggested the existence of the atom but it took almost two millennia before the atom was placed on a solid foothold as a fundamental chemical object by John Dalton (1766-1844). Although two centuries old, Dalton's atomic theory remains valid in modern chemical thought.    Dalton's Atomic Theory:\\n\\n1) All matter is made of atoms. Atoms are indivisible and indestructible.\\n\\n2) All atoms of a given element are identical in mass and properties\\n\\n3) Compounds are formed by a combination of two or more different kinds of atoms.\\n\\n4) A chemical reaction is a rearrangement of atoms. \\n \\n\\n\\nModern atomic theory is, of course, a little more involved than Dalton's theory but the essence of Dalton's theory remains valid. Today we know that atoms can be destroyed via nuclear reactions but not by chemical reactions. Also, there are different kinds of atoms (differing by their masses) within an element that are known as "isotopes", but isotopes of an element have the same chemical properties.\\n\\nMany heretofore unexplained chemical phenomena were quickly explained by Dalton with his theory. Dalton's theory quickly became the theoretical foundation in chemistry.

Yes, I have vaginismus and am working on correcting it now. It is a condition where the the entry to the vagina tightens and causes pain when anything enters or touches it. I am still learning about it but I do know that it's only PARTLY psychological. My OB told me that its an actual condition. First and foremost if you speculate that your gf has this condition, do NOT have intercourse. It will make it worse! Second, she needs to see her OB. He will definitely be able to help. Mine prescribed lidocaine (which is a cream that numbs the skin) for me to use on myself. He said it is fixable but takes patience and work. He told me it could be up to 6 months before we have intercourse again. \\nMy advice to you would be to 1. Be patient, supportive, and understanding with her. It is extremely painful. So it's understand not to want to have sex, or even look forward to it.\\nI hope I helped!
The Helios Gene Gun is a new way for in vivo transformation of cells or organisms (i.e. gene therapy and genetic immunization (DNA vaccination)). This gun uses Biolistic ® particle bombardment where DNA- or RNA-coated gold particles are loaded into the gun and you pull the trigger. A low pressure helium pulse delivers the coated gold particles into virtually any target cell or tissue. The particles carry the DNA so that you do not have to remove cells from tissue in order to transform the cells.YOU CAN GO TO THE LISTED SOURCES TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE GENE GUN AND U CAN ALSO SEE A PICTURE

Love never fails.\\nif you still feel all the above from this man after all these years... then cherish him from today onward..
No.  That's the point of invisible.  You get invisible so that others DON"T KNOW you are online.  Being able to find out completely defeats the purpose.
If you can afford it and you think it will actually help you prepare for your university entrance exam better than you can prepare on you own then I say it's worth a try. However, if it will be a burden to you then I say do the best you can on your own.

We moved from a big city to a rural area about 8 years ago. I didn't expect that I would miss some of the things I miss about living in town. I guess I just didn't think much about them until they were gone. \\n\\nI miss the incredible library system to take my kids too that we used to have. We went every week and loved it! The lone libarary building in our county houses a mere 2% of what we used to have access to. They don't even interlibrary loan there. We have had to get an out of county card ($$$) to get access to a slightly larger library with interlibrary loan that we drive 120 miles round trip to access. Needless to say, long gone are the weekly library visits.\\n\\nI miss having businesses within a quick drive. Driving so far to get anywhere can really become tiresome when you live way out. It is about 60 miles round trip to the grocery store. Want to see a movie? The nearest theater is 120 miles round trip. Now that I have two kids in the church youth group, I find that the time I spend on the road has increased or I have to tell them no to some of the church events because of the 60 mile round trip drive.\\n\\nI worry about whether my children will be able to live nearby when they are grown because job oprtunities are few here.\\n\\nOK, now what do I love about the country. \\n\\nI love the wildlife moments. I love seeing deer come up and drink from the stream that cuts through our yard in front of our living room window. I love the experiences like hearing a noice on the front porch and stepping out to find yourself 4 feet away from a fox or an armidillo - right there on the porch with you! I love hearing and watching the hawks that perch on the kid's swingset in the rain as they watch for crayfish, snakes, lizards, rabbits, and mice that stir in the yard or the edge of the woods. I love the 8 month study of stream life we did two summers ago where we monitored our stream daily, caught tadpoles, minnows, and crayfish for study in our indoor tank before releasing them full grown to create the next generation of crayfish and frogs. I love being surrounded by woods and enjoying the cool of them on hot summer days.\\n\\nI love the people of the Southern countryside. On average they are so much more humble, friendly, and willing to love you than the average city dweller. A retired lady two doors down calls me darlin', and hun' and always says goodbye with 'I love you.'\\n\\nI love that we live in a 2000 sq. foot house with a nice big yard and it only cost $40K. We watched one of those home shows on PBS last week and our jaws dropped at the prices they said that moderate priced houses in DC go for. Yikes! How can anyone but the ultra rich ever survive there?\\n\\nOne warning about rural country life though, when you move to the country they pay you welcome visits even before 8 am in the morning. Not one, not two, but about twelve neighbors and church members paid visits in our first two weeks after moving in to our house all before 10am in the morning. Mornings in the country are an active time of the day.\\n\\nSo what do I prefer, country life or big city life? I guess after eight years in the country I must be adjusting pretty well now. I guess I will take the long drives to access the conveniences I once enjoyed mere miles and minutes away for the love of country neighbors, the wonder of God's creation, and a morgage that we can afford and still have a life after.

Do NOT, I repeat, DO NOT use a tanning OIL with an SPF of 4.  I learned the hard way that it's for middle-eastern men, not fair-skinned white girls.  An SPF 15 will still allow you to tan.  You can try an SPF 8 spray on if you don't burn easily, but again....don't go for anything lower than that.

Its hard to guess sometimes if she is trying to be hard. show interest and ignore. Look for her reactions. you should get some idea
THere are alot of varibles when it comes to men 30-35.  I however find, that no matter what the age, getting something hold meaning for the person is the best.  What are his interests?  If he is way into the outdoors, for example,  a book about all the best campsites around might be good.   If he is way into cars, then perhaps a subscription to a magazine about cars.  The key is haveing some knowlegde about what that person likes, and finding a gift that shows you know them, is better than something really expensive.\\n\\n\\nOff hand, I would say that 30-35 year olds are pretty set in most of the things they are interested in.  Whats his favorite band?    Would he enjoy you cooking dinner for him.   MAybe work is stressful and a masssage would be a  good thing.

Hi Gharsha,\\n\\nMy experience throughout group discussions is that you should demonstrate actively your mentality but with correctness and intelligence. Indeed, being relaxed and confident helps a lot, but not to the point they perceive you may be too comfortable or even arrogant. Yes, perceptions count and often they buy-in the wrong ones! \\n\\nWhen it comes to a personal interview is easier because you don’t have to compete, only to be honest and give the interviewer as much useful info as you can. Some questions are surprisingly ambiguous, e.g.: “talk me about you”. Don’t panic! You have to follow a coherent line, so sometimes is good for you to require a more specific question –keeping your nice smile-: “Oh, yes…like about how I look at myself? Or about my family? About my past, student experience? About my latest work experience?” Obviously the answers are free, but being a little bit more specific info helps you not to panic (and getting your mind in blank!). \\n\\nI guess the most difficult part comes when they ask you to talk about “future”. Great businessmen have warned me you’ve just to tell companies what they expect to listen. If you plan to study a master or doctorate in France within 2 years, probably they won’t hire someone who will quit the company in an early future, so don’t say it!!! You dream to work in that company, and you’ll be there the rest of your life working for them –that’s what they expect to listen. Despite the prior, make it clear you’re a person with ambitions and not mediocre –just keep your aces under your sleeves, gotcha?- They hire what they need, and… believe me, when you’re not useful to them anymore, it’d be real strange if they don’t fire you. For me, too, that’s a tough point, but hey, it’s globalization, and nowadays loyalty doesn’t exist at all, likely a multi-national company just buy a little company and then everybody’s out. \\n\\nAdditionally, is always interesting to ask about the performance, growing, development, career opportunities and: THE GOLDEN RULE: The salary and benefits package, always, always are discussed at the end of interviews or negotiations, don’t even mention it if they don’t touch that issue, wait at the end –when they seem to be so interested on you-. If the company is real good and you really project yourself staying there some time, you can always sacrifice a little money, exchanging it for experience, vitae, training or relationships in order to escalate to better positions-in that company or any other one-.\\n\\nI hope those tips helped you. Please pardon my English mistakes, but Spanish, Catalan and French really mix my mind up!\\n\\nGood luck, and tell me if you succeed!\\n\\nAlfonso

Congrats on your success with Latin.  70% of the Western Indo-European languages are based on Latin.  \\n\\nWhich means that all languages that were native to the European continent in times past are mostly derivative from the Latin language.\\n\\nThat to say, Italian is immersed in the Latin language. So is the French.  Russian is less so but I don't know a lot about the origin of Russian but it probably has more Eastern influence than Italian.\\n\\nEastern languages (e.g., Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Hebrew, etc.) are more based in pictographic language forms (or pictures).  These are far from the Latin base of languages.
As cells differentiate, certain genes are silenced.  This silencing is done by modifying the histones (a sort of protein spool about which DNA is wrapped) and making the DNA rather bunched up, and inaccessible to the transcrition factors and promoters that activate a gene.  The totipotent cell requires that none of its genes are thus silenced, while cells with a silenced gene will see the same silencing in its daughter cells.

Marriages end because people become selfish and do not care about working as a team with their spouse.  They also can be shallow and fall out of love with their spouse's physical appearance because they are full of their own desires and don't care about the other person's feelings at all.  \\nA guy like this is not worth your time.  Find some things that you enjoy doing that make you happy and fill your heart with joy, so that you can get your mind off of him.  He's not worth your pain if he did this to you.

THE UNIMAGINABLE but ultimately inescapable truth is that we are going to have to get ready for war with Iran. \\n\\nWhile we were chasing phantom nuclear weapons in Mesopotamia, next door Iran was busy building real ones. \\n\\nThe unavoidable reality is that we now need urgently to steel ourselves to the ugly probability that diplomacy will not now suffice: one or way or another, unconscionable acts of war may now be unavoidable. \\n\\nThose who say war is unthinkable are right. Military strikes, even limited, targeted and accurate ones, will have devastating consequences for the region and for the world.\\n\\nIf Iran gets safely and unmolested to nuclear status, it will be a threshold moment in the history of the world, up there with the Bolshevik Revolution and the coming of Hitler. \\n\\nAnd so we must ready ourselves for what may be the unthinkable necessity.
There's a lot of ways, I'm sure you'll get alot of answers, so here are a few:\\n\\n1) External USB hard drive\\n-- this is the easiest way, IMHO.  All you do is plug it into the wall, plug it into the USB port, and you are done!  You can get an 80GB drive for less than $100.  Also, you can easily bring your HD to another computer, at work for instance.  The downside is transfer rates.  If you have a old computer, it might only support USB1.0, which will be slower than 2.0 (USB2.0 devices will work with USB1.0, but data transfer will be slower).  USB1.0 is fine for reading MP3's, but it will be a little slow when transfering large amounts of data back and forth.  (Looking at the specs on DELL, it looks like your computer has USB2.0).\\n\\nHere are some USB hard drives:\\n\\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/search/ref=br_ss_hs/104-6257906-0810344?search-alias=aps&keywords=external%20USB%20hard%20drive\\n\\n2) Internal Harddrive\\n-- Looks like you have a notebook.  This is rather more complex, you have to buy a HD with more capacity than your existing HD, transfer your contents over using another computer, then install the new HD.  I wouldn't go this route.\\n\\n3) Network Attached Storage (NAS)\\n\\nA little more complex and expensive than external USB.  The benefits is you can mount this to your home/work network, and any computer on the network can access it.  However, this means you have to have a network at home, typically with some sore of DHCP server (most home routers).  Networking setup takes more time than setting up the USB.  The cheaper NAS devices I have seen, from Netgear for instance, have poorer user reviews than the simpler USB drives.\\n\\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009RML8S/sr=8-1/qid=1142849285/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-6257906-0810344?%5Fencoding=UTF8\\n\\nHope that helps, I'm sure you'll get more options from other users.

The Robot Co-op has built a series of interconnected sites: 43 Things, 43 Places, and 43 People. \\n\\n\\n43 Things lets you record a list of goals or dreams. The basic question you answer is, "What Do You Want To Do With Your Life?" 43 Places is a list of all the places you would like to visit. The place can be as specific as a particular store or as general as outer space. 43 People contains the list of people you would like to meet. Each site allows you to keep a record of the accomplishments, trips, and meetings you have achieved. Your entries can be as frequently as you like. You can also add comments to other's entries.\\n\\nWhen you visit other people's lists, you can choose to send them a 'cheer'. When someone sends you a cheer, it shows that they are supporting you in that particular goal.\\n\\nThe sites provide the functionality of uploading photos, integrate with an existing Flickr account, and be able to cross post content to your own blog elsewhere.

I think it may have been a valid reason to the person that complained and Customer Care, if not to you. The reason why is no one else had the background info that you did in your mind; you knew they where all singers and that by listing 3 similar people you where attempting to indicate a comparison, but this is VERY vague to someone who doesnt know what you where thinking when you wrote it. Three names; who the heck are these people? Question mark; what does he want to know??? \\n\\nNo offence, but I am sure I would have reported it as not a question or at least posted a response asking you to elaborate as well. The way to avoid this type of response from others it to take the time to ask a full question with detail...think of a quiz for school where they simply list three  names of historic figures followed by a question mark...would you know that your teacher wanted you to compare their effect on the civilized world as it is today, with no other information, or would you fail miserably? My point is, do as you did with this question; fill the reader in on all the important parts they need to come up with a good answer for you. Read it again before you post it to see if it will make sense to others.\\n\\nHope this helps to clarify the situation. Good luck with all your future questions!

web programming is about the most benign thing you can do on a computer (although you may consider dual monitors), as for some of the other things, especially mySQL etc with large databases, ram is good - more is better. For web serving a pIII dual 1GHz box would work just fine, so just about anything you can find out there today will be satisfactory. Depending on the web-server configuration and the number of hits you're getting, multi threading will really pay off though, so look for dual core if you're hosting a really really popular site. Never worked with Oracle, so I can't speak to that one..\\n\\nWhen you're building a computer, if you want to minimize latency especially on first loads, you'll want a faster hard drive (say a raptor) 10k and 15k rpm drives have lower latencies and can stream data faster. Having more ram (depending on the os) will allow for more data to stay in ram, reducing the number of trips to the hard drive (your biggest data bottleneck on a modern pc).\\n\\nFor just about any home use, your canned amd64 3500+, 1GB of ram, 7200 rpm 300GB hard drive, geforce 6600gt, 16x dvd drive, and 300-400watt power supply will work just fine.\\n\\nIf you want cutting edge, amd64 X2 4400+, 2GB low latency (e.g. corsair xms or kingston hyperX) ram, 10k rpm raptors (or 15krpm scsi, but you'll have to get a card and possibly 80-60 pin converter), and a 7800GTX or X1800/1900.\\n\\nIMO unless you're doing predominantly video work, stay away from intel for now, they're too hot and for just about everything else, you'll get better performance out of an amd64.
Yes, the Holocaust is a historical fact. The actual number of Jews killed depends on how you compute it.\\nComparing the registered Jews in Europe from register before and after the war, you get missing names that vary between 5.8 and 6.2 mil. Body counts go around 3 mil, death camp registers and on-site execution reports may account for over 5 mil deaths.\\nThe exact number is unknown but most historians agree to a nunmber a little over 5 million, while revisionists say the number is exaggerate and have tone it down to what direct evidece states (around 3 mil) while Zionists bring the number around 7 mil.

I'm not sure of exactly what you're asking, but I think what you're asking is for suggestions on what you might write in a cover letter in order to land your first job ever, or your first job in a new industry.\\n\\nThe short answer is...it depends. If you have experience in another industry and want to switch industries, talk about how skills you used in your other jobs can be used in the job you are seeking (You should really research the job/industry you are trying to switch to so that you can really target the right skills and explain how you will add value).\\nIf you are pursuing your first job ever, you should focus on demonstrating your character traits and how you've shown them in other arenas.  If you are hard-working, then you might want to talk about all of the organizations you held a leadership role in while in school, and your excellent GPA.  If you are an excellent communicator, talk about your grades in English, your work on the school newspaper.  \\n\\nIf you are in a position to do it, pursue an internship.  Most companies offer only college credit, but some do offer a small stipend. Internships are great because the employer knows that he/she will be getting mostly students with no work experience, and that's fine, because that is the point of an internship.\\n\\nSo, to sum this up...\\nYou should begin your letter by introducing yourself and telling the employer what type/title of position you are seeking.  Then, explain why you want to work for their company and what you offer.  Highlight the skills you believe make you a great candidate.  Then, ask for an interview by either indicating that you have attached a resume for their consideration, or that you will be available for interview on (date) and can be reached by phone or email (include address).

One of the most important factors, that nobody else ever seems to care about (and it pisses me off to no end), is the RESOLUTION of the monitor. And I've never seen an LCD tv that has a resolution higher than 1280*1024 (an "amazing" performance, achieved in the last millennium by over 99% of the common 17" CRT monitors and many 15" monitors too).\\n\\nThe 27" beast you mention makes no exception; its resolution is even lower: 1280*720. My Viewsonic VA1912w (19") already beats it (1440*900) and my (older) 19" CRT totally humiliates it (1600*1200). Even my 15" laptop screen has 1400*1050.\\n\\nWhat this means (having a HUGE monitor with a low resolution) is that you won't have more pixels on the screen (actually, you'll probably have less), but the pixels will be larger.\\nJust like zooming into a low-resolution image. It gets bigger but it doesn't look any better.\\n\\nNow, 1280*1024 is plenty enough for TV (and HDTV), so that display is perfectly good for watching TV, from a comfortable distance. And this is the key: it is a TV, not a computer monitor! It's probably good enough for games too, because games don't need very high resolutions. What matters for games is the low latency for fast and impressive action.\\n\\nHowever, if you want to do serious graphics, don't settle for anything less than 1600*1200. It's just not worth it. And you can find that resolution (or higher) in LCD monitors (not TVs!) starting from 20".

At one time, about 100 years ago, the mormon church advocated polygomy... that is having more than one wife.  The mormon church no longer condones that practice.  But, there are sects of the religion in the Western U.S. that still do practice polygamy.  However, it is important to understand that the church they associate with does not condone their actions.

First, the Pentagon is *always* formulating combat strategies against other countries -even our allies.  Some strategies just have more priority than others.\\n\\nBut besides that, Bush is not going to reinstitute the draft.  First, it would be total political suicide if he did, second, the Pentagon has explicitly said they *don't* want any drafted personnel, and third, we have a lot more personnel available for a sustained campaign against Iran (should we go to war) than is reported.  The main problem would be maintaining a force in Iran until the country's rebuilt -that's the main concern the Pentagon has when it comes to troop levels.  Of course, the Army always wants more soldiers in a location, no matter how many are there already.\\n\\nAlso, Charlie Rangel is a member of the House of Representatives, not the Senate.  Though it is true that he introduced the draft bill & voted against it.  But that was just a political stunt.
As idrathernotsay says, we form our most important impression of others in no time at all. \\nI'd only like to add that I believe you are mistaken when you think that we know "it's going to work out".

Our parish was one of the first in the U.S. to be named in honor of St. Pius X, the "Pope of the Eucharist." He was so named because he established reception of the sacrament of the Eucharist by children. His life, in part, was modeled after St. Vincent de Paul with the deep understanding that "the will of God is not to live for oneself, but for all others." \\n\\nBishop Edward A. Fitzgerald, Bishop of Winona, established the Church of St. Pius X on July 1, 1954. Msgr. Warren J. Ryan was appointed the first pastor and was responsible for the planning and development of the parish facilities during the first nine years. The first liturgies were celebrated at Miracle Mile Shopping Center, which served as a temporary church until March 1955. From that time until August of 1955, services were held in Lourdes Chapel at Assisi Heights. The fist Mass was celebrated in the social hall (Kennedy Hall) of the new church Roncalli Hall), on the feast of St. Pius X, September 3, 1955, and at that time the combination school and church building were formally dedicated by Bishop Fitzgerald. The cost of the three structures (Kennedy Hall, Roncalli Hall, and the parish rectory) was $245,000.00. The church had a seating capacity for 600. The social hall could seat 400, and was used for basketball, school lunch, and social gatherings, much like it is today. The parish rectory was originally just one story. \\n\\nThe school (built at a cost of $250,000.00) was opened for the first classes a year later in September 1956 with an enrollment of 325 students in grades one through eight. Preliminary plans included construction on only eight classrooms, but demographic studies indicated much growth, prompting a decision to expand the school size to 20 classrooms. The school would eventually include 19 classrooms, a library, an office and nurse's room, to serve up to 750 students. \\n\\nDuring the parish's first pastorate, that of Fr. Ryan, the parish grew from 300 families to 800 families. Besides the erection of the combination church and school, the rectory and convent were completed and preliminary plans were made for the new church. During the next eleven years, St. Pius X continued to grow in numbers and facilities, and soon became the largest parish in the Diocese of Winona. The new church was erected at a cost of $404,000.00 in 1964.
The best thing is to give a training video for all new hires, and have a written policy on the companies view on harassment, what constitutes harassment, and what the consequences are.  Most people will behave themselves if they know the organization takes it seriously.  Have each person sign a sheet that they have received the training, so if anything happens, you can show that your organization did not create a workplace permissive of this behavior.

What is fifth disease?\\nFifth disease, or erythema infectiosum, is a contagious viral illness that is much more common in children than adults. It is also known as "slapped cheek disease" because of the distinctive rash that some people develop on the face.\\n\\nFifth disease is spread mostly by coughs and sneezes. Generally, people can spread fifth disease only when flulike symptoms are present and before a rash develops. Some people who have fifth disease, such as those who have certain blood disorders or impaired immune systems, may be contagious for a longer time. \\n\\nWhat causes fifth disease?\\nFifth disease is caused by a virus called human parvovirus B19. \\n\\nWhat are the symptoms?\\nThe incubation period—the time from exposure to the virus until symptoms develop—is 4 to 20 days. Initial symptoms usually resemble a mild flu (generally without fever), sometimes followed by a bright red rash on the face, and later a lace-like rash on the body. The rash usually fades within 2 to 5 days and may reappear with exposure to sunlight, warm temperatures, or stress. After the rash appears, your child is no longer contagious and can return to school or daycare.\\n\\nJoint pain and swelling, lasting several weeks or even months, and headache may also occur. Adults develop these symptoms more often than children. \\n\\nNot all people with fifth disease get a rash or feel sick.\\n\\nHow is it diagnosed?\\nFifth disease is diagnosed through a medical history and physical examination by a health professional. A diagnosis of fifth disease is generally easier if a person develops the distinctive rash associated with the infection.\\n\\nHow is it treated?\\nIn uncomplicated cases, home treatment (including rest, fluids, and pain relievers) is usually the only care needed for fifth disease. If complications develop, close monitoring by a health professional or hospitalization may be required.\\n\\nComplications of fifth disease\\nIn fifth disease, the body stops producing red blood cells for a short time. This usually does not cause a problem for an otherwise normally healthy child or adult. However, it can become a serious threat for people who have blood disorders, such as sickle cell disease and thalassemia. These people can develop transient aplastic crisis, a rapid worsening of existing anemia that usually lasts 7 to 10 days. People who have transient aplastic anemia can become very sick; symptoms include fever, lethargy, rapid heart rate, and rapid breathing.\\n\\nPeople who have impaired immune systems who become infected with fifth disease may develop a chronic parvovirus B19 infection that can lead to severe anemia.\\n\\nMedical treatments for complications of fifth disease\\nPregnant women and people who have impaired immune systems or blood disorders are at risk for developing complications from fifth disease.\\n\\nTreatment for pregnant women\\nIn very rare cases, a fetus that becomes infected with parvovirus B19 may develop severe anemia and swelling, a condition called fetal hydrops. The mother and fetus should be closely monitored with fetal ultrasounds to detect this condition. \\n\\nWhen fetal hydrops is detected, the fetus may be treated with blood transfusions while in the uterus, although this is not usually necessary.\\n\\nSome babies born to mothers who were infected with fifth disease during pregnancy may also be treated with blood transfusions.\\n\\nTreatment for people who have blood or immune disorders\\nPeople who have blood disorders that cause anemia (such as sickle cell disease or thalassemia) may require blood transfusions if a rapid worsening of existing anemia (called transient aplastic anemia) develops.\\n\\nIntravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) may be given to people who have impaired immune systems to prevent a chronic parvovirus B19 infection and severe anemia.
Vaginal yeast infections are caused by Candida albicans, which, along with a few types of bacteria, are normally present in relatively small numbers in your crotch. sometimes the yeast multiply rapidly and take over, causing a full-fledged yeast infection, or, in the heart-warming terminology of the medical establishment, candidiasis or monilia. this can be due to a change in the vaginal environment, injury, sexual transmission, or HIV. common environmental disruptions that favor yeast include increased pH, increased heat and moisture, allergic reactions, elevated sugar levels, hormonal fluxes, and reductions in the populations of bacteria that are normally present. \\n\\nSome infections flourish in non-cotton, tight, or dirty clothes that trap heat and moisture. \\nyour safest bet is unbleached, undyed cotton underwear and breathable clothes. it's a good idea to change your underpants regularly, like maybe once a day. if at all possible, don't sleep in underwear; if you do, put on clean stuff. yeast can live in your underwear, so be sure to wash it well, particularly during and after a yeast infection. some medical types think that when you have a yeast infection, you should wash and dry your underwear and then iron it or throw it in the microwave on high for 5 min to kill the yeast. \\n\\nchemicals, such as inks, dyes, and perfumes, can upset the balance in your crotch or trigger allergic reactions that lead to yeast infections. the classic example is commercial douches, which have no benefits and are definitely harmful to the vaginal environment and your health. \\n\\n  condoms can promote yeast infections in two different ways. first, a lot of condoms come packaged with a lubricant that contains nonoxynol-9, a spermicide that may kill the HIV virus. several recent studies have shown that nonoxynol-9 is linked to yeast infections. if you suspect this is your problem, try using a condom that doesn't have a spermicidal lubricant, and use a different spermicide or additional barrier protection. condoms can also cause yeast infections if you are allergic to latex, although this is less common. if this is the case, don't give up hope on practicing safer sex. you may want to try some of the newer plastic (polyurethane) condoms for boys or girls. \\n\\nHormones, both naturally-occurring and artificially introduced, can affect yeast. for example, pregnant women are particularly prone to yeast infections. many women taking contraceptive pills experience regular yeast infections as their hormone levels fluctuate\\n\\nSymptoms:\\nFeels like an intense itching, burning sensation, localized in your vagina and vulva. this itching is not always present, but can get really bad, so bad you can hardly walk, let alone ride your bike to the pharmacy or doctor to get it treated. \\n\\nsmells like bread or beer. in fact, it smells pretty much exactly like yeast, although the yeast used in brewing and baking is an entirely different species (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). no bacteria could smell like that, so it's a great diagnostic. \\n\\nMonistat has a purportedly 1-day treatment called Monistat-1. the active ingredient is tioconazole, a scary-powerful antifungal drug. \\n\\nI hope this helps! Let me know!

I so can't believe no one answered this question! Ok here goes......\\n\\n (Ok now am I allowed to have fun with it or do I have to attack it seriously? Ok....we'll see what comes out)\\n\\nA sociopath obviously will have anti social behavior. For what reasons? Numerous! But a sociopath many times withdraws from society because of hating themselves. Ok something in society could have brought them to this conclusion, but many have been known to be so unhappy with who they are that they remove themselves from any and all social relationships and contact.\\n\\nNarcissists on the other hand (ok say that three times fast)have an abundance of self adoration! However, they become so preoccupied and fixated upon themselves that they develop a lack of awareness of others. They lack empathy toward others as they fall out of sync with societal gestures of kindness and generosity and sincere concern. However, I don't believe they become anti-social. They have a need to point out to others their fine attributes. It is not enough to love thyself........they must make sure others accept them in the same way. Perhaps society shuns them for this just enough to make them feel the need to love themselves in a way no one else seems to. \\n\\nNow as I said in the beginning.......there are NUMEROUS reasons we fall into the categories of sociopathic and narcissistic behaviors. All cases are different. So my answer is...........No...not always. (and oftentimes not)\\n\\nOk......when I started off I was so going to make this funny.

Alot of Christians (not all) feel there as to be a show.  They are christian so therefore they feel there is a certain way to act and be.  whether it be in just public or in private life as well.  It is difficult to go to church and try to get right with god.  They see your faults and you feel as though they are looking down on you.  There are quite a few of them out there.  However I know that there are plenty who are not.  from my experience there is a face they where.  to show sinners the way to be. (though it doesnt actually work this way) my advice is to try to find a church or a christian group which you feel comfortable with and try to grow and learn with them,  as i said they arent all like that some times you just need to sift through the mess to find them.

The question is why doesn't your family like her, is it justified. Sometimes we refuse to see things others can because we are blinded by love.

And remember they will always be your family, and if their reasons are bogus then marry her because true love is hard to find.

Maria Montessori's desire to help children was so strong, however, that in 1906 she gave up both her university chair and her medical practice to work with a group of sixty young children of working parents in the San Lorenzo district of Rome. It was there that she founded the first Casa dei Bambini, or "Children's House." What ultimately became the Montessori method of education developed there, based upon Montessori's scientific observations of these children's almost effortless ability to absorb knowledge from their surroundings, as well as their tireless interest in manipulating materials. Every piece of equipment, every exercise, every method Montessori developed was based on what she observed children to do "naturally," by themselves, unassisted by adults. \\n\\nChildren teach themselves. This simple but profound truth inspired Montessori's lifelong pursuit of educational reform, methodology, psychology, teaching, and teacher training--all based on her dedication to furthering the self-creating process of the child.

Difficult question you post that could cause many to drop down a "knee jerk" answer.  First of course everyone will say that human life is of more value than any natural resource.  But think of all the people who'd die of cold in the winter without oil.  And the economics of high priced oil can leave millions out of work and in some really dire circumstances.  However it's the "in the long run" portion of your question that makes me say that war for oil is not worth it.  The correct thing to do, and I believe this with every fiber in my being, is to find ways around the problem of oil.  Capitalism is suppose to be the perfect system where if a resource is not quite as abundant as one would hope, and therefore more expensive, then the market will find a way around it.  New energies, conservation, etc.  The fact that the powerful in business and politics right now don't want to "waste" their money researching these things and would rather ride on others backs to fight for cheaper oil is idiotic.  \\nOn the bright side, the President mentioned this exact idea in his State of the Union Address.  Whether it was simple lip service or not remains to be seen.

Although there are several different aspects of online courses, there are many things that have been done through many colleges and universities to bring the online students together.  For example, with the classes that I have taken, there is a discussion board that allows you and other classmates to post interesting topics and help each other with puzzling issues that may arise during the completion of coursework.  In addition, if extra help is needed, there is generally a phone number that you can call for technical support or for assistance.  This can prove to be especially useful when you are enrolled in a math course.  You can e-mail assignments whenever you like, watch lectures on DVD or videotape whenever you like, and do classwork at your convenience.  It actually saves alot of time since you don't have to commute to school and spend alot of time getting ready to go to class.  You can sit at home and do your work in your pajamas! :o)  One thing that I would highly recommend is that you be mindful of the concept of networking and forming outside interests while you are completing your coursework.  Since you are not physically attending classes at a college or university, you still need sufficient time for social activities.  Some colleges give you a start date and an end date to complete coursework.  It is up to you to plan your schedule accordingly.  If you do decide to take an online class, I would recommend that you establish a schedule immediately for your coursework when you get the syllabus and list of assignments.  Make sure that you complete the assignments in a timely fashion.  It also helps to have a buddy that will hold you accountable for completing your reading and written assignments.  I'm sure that this policy will vary from college to college, but when it comes time to take exams, often times with the online class, the professor will not give a time limit and you can take all the time that you want to complete your exam in the presence of a proctor.  This really takes off alot of pressure.  Allow for plenty of time to complete assignments and if you can do it, try to complete your coursework in advance.  If you are an independent learner and don't like to waste time, online classes might be for you.  I hope that some of these suggestions may be helpful to you.  If you want to talk more about online classes, you may shoot me a note.

The only birth control pills I've ever heard of are from the doctor. However, in the US there is a place called planned parenthood where you can see a Doc, get pills and checked up fast. It is also cheap or free.
Ebay is the best answer since you'll find out how much the books ACTUALLY sell for, but it's often no good for single issues (a random issue of X-Men or Superman can fluctuate between 1.50 and 10.00 between listings unless it's traded particularly often because without a steady stream of buying and selling you'd dependant upon a few random buyers and just because I'm willing to pay $10 for one issue doesn't mean anyone else would.)\\n\\nhttp://www.comicspriceguide.com/ has individual issues, and you can also try any comic store website to see what they price it at.  Keep in mind that these prices are usually at a premium and not necessarily what you could expect to get if you, for instance, listed them on Ebay or sold at a convention.
The tension in the rope is providing the upward force causing the accelerating.\\n\\nFirst you need to find the net force acting on the object.\\nNet force = mass * acceleration.\\nYou are given the acceleration and mass, so this is easy to find.\\n\\nBut the rope does not just need to apply the net force, it must also apply enough additional force to counteract the objects weight.  The weight of the object,\\nWeight = mass * gravity\\n\\nThe overall tension in the rope,\\nTension = mg + ma\\nor the weight of the car + the net force acting on the car.

To be honest the only thing that you can do is just show him that you are there for him. Be yourself with him and show him what real love and affection is supposed to feel like. Only do this if you are really planning on being with him for a long time. You wouldn't want him to fall for you and grow attached to you and all of a sudden yu end upi breaking his heart. Right now just be a real good friend to him and tell him how you feel about him from time to time. And remember always keep it real!!! Be truthful about everything!! Being REAL really does count in the end.\\nGood Luck to you, and I hope that he gets over his heartbreak soon b/c heartbreak is the worst pain to have. BEEN THERE!!!

In the U.S., a state court has jurisdiction over disputes which occur in a state. Cases are heard and evidence presented in a trial court, usually located in a courthouse in the county seat.\\n\\nIf one of the litigants is unsatisfied with the decision of the lower court, the matter may be taken on appeal (but an acquittal in a criminal trial may not be appealed due to the Fifth Amendment protection against double jeopardy). An intermediate appellate court, often called the state court of appeals, will review the decision of the trial court. If still unsatisfied, the litigant can appeal to the highest appellate court in the state, usually called the state supreme court.
yes, a little girl that used to be in the house I grew up in. I saw her twice. Once in tattered rags for clothes and once in like a sunday dress. She actually saved me from falling out of a window when I was young. Her name was Elizebeth and my mom knows that she was murdered close by when the area used to be farmlands in the 1880s I think. It wasn't weird and she was very friendly, although there were some weird things. Like for instance, all the clocks in the house would stop on certain times, and my grandfathers clock (that wasn't wounds and was broken at the time) would randomly work and stop working. She didn't look faded or anything. It was like the little girl was alive.\\n\\nMy mother and I have also smelt smoke every once in a while. It's always weird because I'll start smelling the smoke and theres a kind of feeling. My mom's never led me on about whether my grandpa's spirit was there or not since she would only talk about it if I brought it up. \\n\\nI also think I've seen the outline of a suicide victim's ghost in my girlfriend's house. Long story, but it made me jump since it was so human like but black.
Gas mileage is usually worse in the cold weather. In the cold weather your tire pressure is lower and causes more friction with the ground. \\n\\nAlso the type of gasoline you put in your car is different in the summer and winter. Summer fuel is required to have a lower RVP, to mitigate evaporative emissions caused by higher temperatures. It is literally heavier, with more chemical bonds in the fuel molecules... more bonds to break = higher energy content = better MPG.\\n\\nAnd finally your car also faces more friction driving through cold air because the colder the air is the more dense it is.
I had an arguement with a Christian friend of mine.  When I asked her, "Why doesn't God just make everyone happy" I got a bunch of canned responses (God works in mysterious ways, God wants to give us choice...as if anyone could comprehend what God wants (if there is a God)).  Finally she just said, "I don't know...I'm not God".  THAT'S an honest answer!  I agree, I would rather hear an honest, thought-out response than lines that have been fed to you
You don't convert. You love people for the person that they are. You can tell people how you feel and hope they see your point, but you shouldn't press more than that.

Try advertising at local tack shops in the area, most will have bulletin boards or send out mailers. There is a PetSmart/State Line Tack in Ocala as well (State Line Tack is the horse supply portion of PetSmart).

It seems that this guy loves you alot, more than anything like you are the most important person to the world, He would say you are the girl of his dreams, the one he would want to marry you, sometimes to a guy when he hooks up with a woman he feels more positive about himself and his life love has that kind of affect on relationships, i would say the reason is because he is blinded in love for you make him feel great, and he doesnt want to loose that feeling, and he probbalys is insecure of himself thinking that if he lost you, his postivenes the greatness of love that he is recieving from you will be destroyed so his ego is raised up to a solution which is to doubt you on ur relationship with him. when he ask you that he is answering his greatest fear it is reassuring him, you should try to get him to realize that your love for him is never ending for him and that you feel the same way for him, dont let his insecurity of his feeling in the relationship get you down  instead help him reassure himself in other ways by finding other activitys to help him get reassured of the love and positivness in both of your lifes and continue and i bet you that he will stop accusing you more remember it is his insecurity that he does it find a way to make him secure in that area and your problem will be solved.

Connect the data cable (IDE) exactly how the hard drive has been connected.  Usually, if you connect it the wrong way, it won't go into the drive at all.  If you are in doubt, refer to the manual that came with the drive or on the box.\\n\\nUsually, the jumpre has to be set to slave since the hard drive is the master.  If you have two IDE cables there are 4 options: Primary master and primary slave and Secondary master and secondary slave.  Your hard drive usually will be connected to  primary master.  So, depending upon your choice and any other connected drives set the appropriate option and jumper settings.  These settings are mentioned on the drive itself.  First verify the jumper settings of your hard drive.

As Jehovah's Witnesses, we maintain a strict standing on any kind of involvement in false religious practices, traditions, or ceremonies. With such a wedding taking place in one of the false religious churches of Christendom, we would not attend in order to not offend God or allow anyone there to become under the impression that we share in the false religious part of that particular ceremony.\\n\\n"Been there" doesn't have the slightest idea what they're talking about. Whether a building has windows or not has absolutely nothing to do with it whatsoever. The fact of the matter is that the ceremony will undoubtedly be performed by the church's pastor or priest, and the church itself is steeped in false religious beliefs and practices. True Christians, like her grandmother, would not have any kind of involvement (including attending) in that.
Muawiya was not the founder of Sunni denomination of Islam. (See below)\\n\\nWith 940 million adherents, Sunni Islam is the largest denomination of Islam. Followers of the Sunni tradition are known as Sunnis or Sunnites; they sometimes refer to themselves as Ahlus Sunnah wal-Jamaa'h, "adherents to the Sunnah and the assembly."\\n\\nSunnis have their historical roots in the majority group who followed Abu Bakr, an effective leader, as Muhammad's successor, instead of his cousin and son-in-law Ali. The Sunnis are so named because they believe themselves to follow the sunnah or "custom" of the Prophet.\\n\\nAlgeria has nearly 99% Sunni Muslims (Sunni Islam is the state religion), Kuwait has 70% and Afghanistan has a majority of Sunni muslims (around 80%). Sunni Muslims also outnumber Shi'ite Muslims in Israel, Egypt, Turkey, Somalia, Uzbekistan, Sudan (70%), Syria (80%), Tajikistan (85%), Libya (97%), Jordan (92%) and certain islands like the Maldives, Comoros (98%) and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands (80%). Iraq has 45-60% of Sunni Muslims, who are concentrated mostly in the central & northern parts of the country. Sunni Muslims are a minority in Iran (10%) and Bahrain (30%).\\n\\nSunnis base their religion on the Quran and the Sunnah as understood by the majoroty of the community under the structure of the four schools of thought. The four Sunni schools of law (madhahib) - the Hanafi, the Maliki, the Shafi'i and the Hanbali - are sometimes mistakenly understood as different sects, but they are not. These four schools of religious law associate themselves with four great scholars of early Islam: Abu Haneefah, Malik, Shafi'i, and Ahmad bin Hanbal. These scholars were known for their knowledge and piety throughout the Muslim world. They differed only in minor issues of application of certain principles in the religion and were not in opposition to each other. In fact, Ahmad bin Hanbal was a student of Shafi'i, who was a student of Malik.\\n\\nSufism is considered by the majority of Sunnis to be integral part of Sunni Islam. It deals with the spiritual aspects of a Sunni Muslim's everyday life. Some of the most famous Sufi schools are the Qadiri, Naqshbandi, Shadhili, Chishti, and Rifa‘i paths or tariqas.\\n\\nSunnis view the Shi'ites as from the ahlul-bidah; i.e., the people of innovation. Sunnis oppose Shi'ite beliefs concerning some of the companions of the Prophet, the belief in the Imamate and difference on the Caliphate, and others. Other groups considered to be outside Islam by Sunnis are Nation of Islam, Ahmadiyya, and Ismailis.\\n\\nShia Islam includes most of the Muslims that are not counted among the Sunni. The primary division within Islam, between Sunni and Shi'a, dates to the death of the Prophet Muhammad when his followers were faced with the decision of who would be his successor as the leader of Islam. Shi'ites are those who followed Ali, the closest relative of Muhammad, as Muhammad's successor. Today there are approximately 120 million Shi'ite Muslims in the world.\\n\\nThe Shia consist of one major school of thought known as the Jafaryia or the "Twelvers," and a few minor schools of thought, as the "Seveners" or the "Fivers." These names all refer to the number of imams they recognize after the death of Muhammad. The term Shi'a is usually meant to be synonymous with the Jafaryia/Twelvers.\\n\\nThe Origins of the Sunni/Shia split in Islam\\nAli is the central figure at the origin of the Shia / Sunni split which occurred in the decades immediately following the death of the Prophet in 632. Sunnis regard Ali as the fourth and last of the "rightly guided caliphs" (successors to Mohammed (pbuh) as leader of the Muslims) following on from Abu Bakr 632-634, Umar 634-644 and Uthman 644-656. Shias feel that Ali should have been the first caliph and that the caliphate should pass down only to direct descendants of Mohammed (pbuh

Mitosis  is the method used for cell division and reproduction in cells not involved in sexual reproduction. This process starts with one replication (copying of the chromosome material) and one division of the chromosome material.   This results in the chromosome numbers in the two cells produced being the same as in the parent cell. Sexual involves getting genetic material from 2 parent cells.Mitosis  is associated with asexual reproduction, as well as growth and repair in sexually reproducing organisms. The offspring of mitosis are clones of the parent cell.

In computer security technology, a virus is a self-replicating program that spreads by inserting copies of itself into other executable code or documents. A computer virus behaves in a way similar to a biological virus, which spreads by inserting itself into living cells. Extending the analogy, the insertion of a virus into the program is termed as an infection, and the infected file (or executable code that is not part of a file) is called a host. \\n\\nIn the context of computer software, a Trojan horse is a malicious program that is disguised as legitimate software. The term is derived from the classical myth of the Trojan horse. In the siege of Troy, the Greeks left a large wooden horse outside the city. The Trojans were convinced that it was a gift, and moved the horse to a place within the city walls. It turned out that the horse was hollow, containing Greek soldiers who opened the city gates of Troy at night, making it possible for the Greek army to pillage the city. Trojan horse programs work in a similar way: they may look useful or interesting (or at the very least harmless) to an unsuspecting user, but are actually harmful when executed.\\n\\nA computer worm is a self-replicating computer program, similar to a computer virus. A virus attaches itself to, and becomes part of, another executable program; however, a worm is self-contained and does not need to be part of another program to propagate itself. \\n\\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/computer_virus

Paris Reidhead\\n1919-1992\\n\\n     Paris Reidhead devoted his life to communicating the message of the Gospel in America and throughout the world. A student pastor in the rural Minnesota at age eighteen, Mr. Reidhead felt led of the Lord to overseas mission work. In 1945, Paris Reidhead and Marjorie, his wife of two years, traveled under the auspices of the Sudan Interior Mission to the Sudan-Ethiopia Border where they surveyed and analyzed tribal languages in preparation for evangelism and education in this area.\\n\\n     Upon his return to the United States, Mr. Reidhead was appointed Deputation Secretary of the Sudan Interior Mission in the Southeastern United States. He was soon a nationally recognized spokesman for missions.\\n\\n     In 1953 Mr. Reidhead began his national Bible Conference ministry for the Christian and Missionary Alliance which brought him, in 1956, to pastorate of the Gospel Tabernacle, the New York City church where the C & M A was first established by Dr. A. B. Simpson in 1887. While in New York, Mr. Reidhead drew on informational resources at the United Nations to pioneer a program through which government and private funds were used for economic development in the Third World; his efforts to implement local programs on this model took him to mission fields in Africa, Asia, and South America.\\n\\n     Third World development became his full-time commitment in 1966. Mr. Reidhead's vision of public-private funding for economic development led, in 1971, to the formation of the Institute for International Development, Inc. which has served as the model for about ninety evangelical organizations which have, in turn, channeled more than 100 million dollars into Third World development. In 1984, Mr. Reidhead founded Enterprise Development International, a service agency devoted to aiding Third World church and evangelical agencies in creating job opportunities for destitute families.\\n\\n     Since Mr. Reidhead's death in 1992, Bible Teaching Ministries, Inc. continues under the leadership of his wife, Marjorie, and daughter, Virginia Teitt, and a dedicated Board. The message of the Gospel is reaching an ever-widening audience all over the world

Patients with diabetes have higher mortality rates than nondiabetics regardless of sex, age, or affluence. Heart disease and stroke are the leading causes of death in these patients. All life-style and medical efforts should be made to reduce the risk for these conditions. \\n\\nPeople with type 2 diabetes are also subject to nerve damage (neuropathy) and abnormalities in both small and large blood vessels (vascular injuries) that occur as part of the diabetic disease process. Such abnormalities produce complications over time in many organs and structures in the body. Although these complications tend to be more serious in type 1 diabetes, they still are of concern in type 2 diabetes. People with diabetes should aim for fast blood glucose levels of less than 110 mg/dl and hemoglobin A1C or less than 7%. \\n\\nThe impact of these multiple health problems are of great concern, particularly with the dramatic increase in diabetes. Experts now estimate that over a third of people born in 2002 will eventually develop diabetes. \\n\\nThere are two important approaches to preventing complications from diabetes: \\n\\nIntensive control of blood glucose and keeping glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels below 7.0. This is proving to prevent complication due to vascular (blood vessel) abnormalities and nerve damage (neuropathy) that can cause major damage to organs, including the eyes, kidneys, and heart. \\nManaging risk factors for heart disease. Evidence is increasing that control of blood glucose also helps the heart, but its benefits most likely occur over time. It is very important that people with diabetes control blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other factors associated with heart disease.

If you can get a parallel cable to connect your old computer to the new one then choose that option.  Otherwise save the settings in a folder in your hard disk\\n\\n2. Open your old computer case and remove your hard disk.  Now open the case of your old computer and connect the hard disk to the new one.\\n\\n3.  Start the new computer and run the tool again.
There is only one difference between the new pc's that run os x and the ones that don't. A chip that has some information for loading the os. I downloaded a beta version of os x for x86 processors a while before they put in the drivers for that chip and it worked great on my system. All I had to do was install it like I would on a mac.\\nA later beta of os x for x86 had drivers for the chip, and all you had to do was delete them and it worked.\\nAll you need to install it is the cd and those drivers taken off. But in the release version they will make it a little harder because they will try to integrate those drivers throughout the system software, but people will get around it pretty quick probably.\\nI have tried it on intel and amd systems and it worked. It is compatible with most hardware and you can use linux drivers with some hardware without too much trouble. But if you like moc os x, you probably have a strong aversion to terminals because of the old marketing put out by apple and microsoft.
a wireless router will allow you to connect to internet.\\nit actually hides your physical IP address, so that it adds a layer of security. if anybody pings your machine they will get the router IP, which is very generic.
holy shiz man that's not right she's SOO in the wrong but i sounds like you love her but you don't wanna end up hurting her i would say that it's logical to break up with her but maybe she would get worse then. i wish i had all the answers cause your too cool of a guy to have this sorta stuff happen to you. :( please tell me what u end up doing if you don't mind.

If you want to lose weight (since this was in the diet category), you shouldn't eat and then head to bed.  You want to give your body time to burn off some of those calories first.
First, you must upload the video to a web server. In your HTML, use the following tags:\\n<embed src="your_movie_filename.mov"> </embed>\\nOr, a more current practice is to use the <object> tags.\\n\\nAnother easier alternative is to use video sharing web service like www.youtube.com, where you can upload a movie and it will generate the appropriate scripts you can add to your webpage.
If you wanna be happy for the rest of your life marry an ugly person, I mean fugly, that way you know for a fact that they will never cheat on you.
Best Answer - Chosen By Voters\\n\\nThe negative usage of hacker is one who exploits systems or gains unauthorized access through clever tactics and detailed knowledge, that is, through the use of a hack. However, because most hacks do not exploit systems or gain unauthorized access, most people who have enough technical skill to produce clever hacks consider the use of the word hacker in this sense to be bigotry. Malicious hackers in this sense are often called black hat hackers, but it is more appropriate to call them crackers as this is a term which distinguishes the exploitation of security weaknesses from hacking in general. The opposite term of black hat hackers, White hat, are those who attempt to break into systems or networks in order to help the owners of the system by making them aware of security flaws, or to perform some other altruistic activity. Other hackers often viewed negatively include phreakers and software crackers.

http://wiki.ehow.com/Ask-a-Guy-Out\\n\\nHow to Ask a Guy Out\\nGot your eye on a certain cute guy? Well, don't wait--ask him out! If you're shy and don't know how to make this happen, follow these easy steps. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSteps \\nMake sure to hang out in places where you know you will see the guy you have a crush on. This could be at the mall, the movies, or maybe at the baseball field if he's an athlete. \\nWhen you have the opportunity, talk to him or his friends and find out if he has a girlfriend. \\nCommence flirting. This can mean a lot of things, like catching his eye with a glance, touching him lightly on the arm, or laughing at his jokes. Sometimes, you can flirt from afar and entice him to come over to you. \\nAsk him what kind of things he likes to do, such as what he likes to eat, if he likes to play sports, or if he's a movie lover. Once you find something you both have in common, ask if he'd like to do it together sometime. \\nIf he says no, or seems like he needs more time, don't get too upset; always say you can just be friends if that's what he wants. Chances are, he'll change his mind. Guys do this a lot. \\nIf he says yes, then plan where and when you will go out, and don't forget to have fun. \\n\\n\\n\\nTips \\nOn the day you plan to ask the guy out, make sure to wear an outfit that gives you confidence. This will make you much more comfortable and give you the courage to make your move. \\nTry not to be too nervous...guys love being asked out, since they're the ones usually doing all the work in these situations. \\nWarnings \\nSome girls try to get guys to ask them out by making them jealous or playing hard to get. This can backfire because the guy could give up, or get annoyed by your tactics. The best approach is to be honest and straightforward about your feelings. \\nEven if you have asked a guy out, it does not mean you are obligated to do anything you don't want to on the date. If you ever feel uncomfortable, get out of the situation right away.
First of all, I am really glad that you see it as a problem. I am proud of you. I was also curious why you are wanting to practice abstinence until you get married. I know that I also am living that way, because the Bible commands it from me, but I just wanted to know your reasoning behind it. \\n\\nI do know that you can't do it alone. You will need help. I think I know who can help you stay away from this temptation. Jesus can take away even the desire to look at these things. He can help you get through this. I'm not sure how else to explain it, but, if you would like, you can talk to me and I will explain it further. (My email address is on my profile page thingy)
A properly formated Video_TS folder should be playable in QuickTime and burnable with iDVD, both come with SuperDrive Macs and OS X.
This is a step in making tylenol.\\nThis sounds too much like a homework problem for me to just give you an answer, but I can give you a very good hint.  The O atom and N atom in the para positions are on opposite sides of the benzene ring.  The oxygen is more electronegative of the two elements and will pull electron density out of the ring, which will resonate pulling electron density out of the N on the other side.\\nThis help?
In formal scientific terms, a black hole is called a "singularity."  It is a point.  The spherical object often thought of as a black hole is the "event horizon" that is centered on the singularity.\\n\\nThe event horizon is the sphere within which the escape velocity is greater than the speed of light; nothing can exceed the speed of light, so nothing can get out of the event horizon.  \\n\\nHowever, black holes emit "Hawking radiation," as follows.  "Consider a virtual electron-positron pair produced just outside the event horizon. Once the pair is created, the intense curvature of spacetime of the black hole can put energy into the pair. Thus the pair can become non-virtual; the electron does not fall back into the hole. There are many possible fates for the pair. Consider one of them: the positron falls into the black hole and the electron escapes. According to Feynman's view we can describe this as follows:\\nThe electron crosses the event horizon travelling backwards in time, scatters, and then radiates away from the black hole travelling forwards in time." [see the fourth link]\\n\\nBlack holes loose mass by emitting Hawking radiation until all the mass has been radiated.  (Remember that mass can be converted to energy according to E = m x c^2.)  \\n\\nWhen you do the math, it turns out that each black hole will "evaporate" to nothing within a certain time that depends upon its mass, larger black holes having longer lifespans.\\n\\nA black hole that initially weighs 2 x 10^5 kg (200  metric tonnes) will live one second.  A black hole having a mass equal to the sun will live 10^67 years. (Assuming the Universe does not end before then!)\\n\\nSo, the short answer to your question is that the mass that falls into a black hole is converted to energy and radiated into space by the black hole.
It is called Rayleigh Scattering, or Molecular scattering.  This is primarily caused by oxygen and nitrogen molecules, whose effective diameters are at least 0.1 times smaller than the effected wavelengths.  Rayleigh scattering is most influential at the alitudes above 4.5 km, occuring in what is called the pure atmosphere.  The amount of Rayleigh scattering is highly selective, being inversely proportional to the fourth power of wavelength.  Consequently, invisible ultraviolet radiation, at a wavelength of 0.3 micrometers, is scattered 16 times as readily as red wavelengths at 0.6 micrometers.  In the visible spectrum, blue wavelengths at 0.4 micrometers are scattered about five times as readily as red wavelengths at 0.6 micrometers.  The preferential scattering of blue wavelengths explains why the clear sky appears blue in daylight.  The blue wavelengths reach our eyes from all parts of the sky.

Yes, they are considered income.  I would strongly suggest reporting them because welfare agencies share that information with the IRS.
We have to take the FCAT so teachers and other important people know how well you can read and do math. I agree with you about it being unfair. I so agree. But we got to do what we got to do. WHICH STILL IS NOT FAIR.
1*11=11 &1+10=11 & 1-55+65=11\\nyou really need to be more specific as to what kind of formula you are looking for to get the answer that you need, if you don't you could get an infanent amount of answers and they would all be correct in a diferent sence
Most people who do this, don't have a clue about how they look like when they do it. I hope you could place a camera so that you can viedo tape her and then show the film to her. She will be the best judge of her own attitude.\\nAnother tactic to stop families from yelling to each other is to place a "suggestions box", where the members of the family can write their complaints annonimously and then everybody can work things out together.\\nOr play "The Socratic Questioning Game"...this game is very interesting...instead of accusing or yelling...you have to say everyting in the form of a polite question: Instead of saying "Don't yell at me!" you say "Why are you yelling at me?" .."Because you don't listen!"...then you ask "Why do you think I'm not listening?"\\nRules for this game:\\n1.-Accept the answer eventhough you don't like it. An answer is an answer.\\n2.-The question has to be made politely..it is a question, not an interrogation.\\n3.-The process to change a bad habit takes time...yelling and fuzzing is a bad habit...be patient and constant until the cycle breaks and the bad habit disappears.
Just like any other business, hospitals need to market themselves. they all have websites, brochures, and advertising. Most likly the marketing center you are questioning is simply a marketing department, and thay are just trying to sound more sophisticated.\\n\\nIt is also possible that they have a big meeting room or media center wher they put on seminars or workshops. This tool is a marketing strategy. It brings people into the hospital. If they have a really excellent area for this, they may even let the community use it for non hospital business, again, it is just to bring more people into the hospital.\\n\\nBringing people in for any reason helps the comfort level and familiarity with the building, the parking and the ammenities. This will make many people more confidant and comfortable in choosing that hospital when they have a medical need.

How Do I Get Saved?\\nTHE PRAYER OF SALVATION\\nRemember God loves you.  He wants you to be whole and complete or saved – spiritually, emotionally, physically, mentally, financially, and socially (3 John 2).  Pray this prayer, mean it, and YOU will be saved, right where you are sitting. \\n\\nFather in heaven, thank you for sending your Son, Jesus, to die on the cross for me, and for His blood that was shed to redeem me and to cleanse me from my sins.\\n\\nLord, I am sorry and I repent of my sins. Forgive me.  I understand that I must change the course of my life.  I am determined in my heart to follow you.\\n\\nI invite you to become the Lord of my life from this point forward, forever. I openly proclaim and confess that you are the Lord of my life.\\n\\nI believe in my heart that You have been raised from the dead.  Therefore I am saved.  I am a new creature. The old things have passed. All things have become new.  I am a child of God.
From Wikipedia.org:\\n\\n"first devised in 1869 by the Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev. Mendeleev intended the table to illustrate recurring ("periodic") trends in the properties of the elements."\\n\\n"The original table was created before the discovery of subatomic particles or the formulation of current quantum mechanical theories of atomic structure. If one orders the elements by atomic mass, and then plots certain other properties against atomic mass, one sees an undulation or periodicity to these properties as a function of atomic mass. The first to recognize these regularities was the German chemist Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner who, in 1829, noticed a number of triads of similar elements:\\nSome triads Element Molar mass\\n(g/mol) Density\\n(g/cm³) Quotient\\n(cm³/mol)\\nchlorine 35.4527 0.003214 11030\\nbromine 79.904 3.122 25.6\\niodine 126.90447 4.93 25.7\\n \\ncalcium 40.078 1.54 26.0\\nstrontium 87.62 2.64 33.2\\nbarium 137.327 3.594 38.2\\n\\nThis was followed by the English chemist John Newlands, who noticed in 1865 that the elements of similar type recurred at intervals of eight, which he likened to the octaves of music, though his law of octaves was ridiculed by his contemporaries. Finally, in 1869, the German Julius Lothar Meyer and the Russian chemistry professor Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev almost simultaneously developed the first periodic table, arranging the elements by mass. However, Mendeleev plotted a few elements out of strict mass sequence in order to make a better match to the properties of their neighbours in the table, corrected mistakes in the values of several atomic masses, and predicted the existence and properties of a few new elements in the empty cells of his table. Mendeleev was later vindicated by the discovery of the electronic structure of the elements in the late 19th and early 20th century.\\n\\nIn the 1940s Glenn T. Seaborg identified the transuranic lanthanides and the actinides, which may be placed within the table, or below (as shown above)."
An ISP is what you use to access the Internet regardless of your targeted website. There are many of them, some free, some dial up, some highspeed (DSL or Cable).  If you are at school, work or the library, these usually have connections to the Internet so no additional ISP is required.
