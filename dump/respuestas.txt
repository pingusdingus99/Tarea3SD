You absolutely can!  DSL is deregulated, meaning you can get your DSL service from any DSL provider in your area.  While some service providers have restrictions on their subscriptions (i.e. having to purchase your local phone service from them as well), it is ILLEGAL for your phone company to deny you DSL service from any other providers in your area, just like it is ILLEGAL for them to deny you local phone service from any other providers in your area.\\n\\nThere are several DSL providers nationwide (SBC, Verizon, Covad, PacBell (in California), etc.).\\n\\nA quick search of Yahoo gave the following:\\n\\nhttp://dir.yahoo.com/Business_and_Economy/Business_to_Business/Communications_and_Networking/Broadband/Digital_Subscriber_Line__DSL_/\\n\\nHowever, your options as to whom provides DSL in your area may be limited.

The Body Mass Index is a useful measure of an individual's current weight related to an ideal body weight. An ideal BMI is generally between 20.5 and 21.5.

aaronsdaddy is not really correct. In any 740 day period, any day a Guardsman/Reservist spends deployed (whether overseas or in the States) is called a "high tempo day". If you accumulate more than 400 "high tempo days" you become effectively non-deployable. If a deployment will take you over 400 "high tempo days" in the middle of the deployment, you greatly lessen your chances of being deployed.\\n\\nIt is still technically possible to be deployed with more than 400 high tempo days, but the general grade officers that be have to jump through so many hoops they have decided it is just easier to activate someone else who has the high tempo days available to rack up.\\n\\nIf you are a Reservist and you want to volunteer, just talk to your personnel sergeant. I guarantee you that he will hook you up. And if you want to go, let them know. Maybe someone else who doesn't want to go will owe you a kegger when you get back.
Not every day
yes, it does.  \\n\\nhere's how evaporation works: the molecules of the water are bouncing around and colliding with each other, randomly changing direction and speed all the time.  when one molecule near the surface randomly gets a kick towards the surface (if it's moving fast enough to overcome the strength of hydrogen bonding) it will exit the condensed water and literally come shooting out of the liquid and into the air.  \\n\\nthe reverse process (condensation) happens at the same time - water molecules in the atmosphere will randomly go shooting into the surface of the liquid, where they are captured by water's hydrogen bonds.  if the air is humid enough, this will happen at the same rate as evaporation and the result will be called a dynamic equilibrium - water is evaporating and condensing in equal amounts and the water level will appear static.\\n\\nanyway, if you turn the temperature of the water up, the molecules move faster.  this is how we interpret the meaning of temperature on the microscopic level.  so, faster-moving molecules are more likely to overcome the hydrogen bonding, and therefore more often escape the water's surface, which results in faster evaporation.

First you must understand the notation that is being used to represent the chord.  The Bsus2 is the chord while the /B indicates the inversion that is being played (The note that is the lowest). Since the lowest note being played is the root then the chord is in its first inversion. That means that the /B part is redundant and not necessary. The author of the tab should not have notated the chord this way because it is confusing. Since the /B part is not necessary you should play a regular Bsus2 chord.\\n\\nFor more information visit (found via Google):\\nhttp://www.all-guitar-chords.com/

dajjal is an evil figure in Islamic eschatology, who will appear before Yaum al-Qiyamah (Day of the Resurrection). He is highly similar to the Antichrist in Christianity.\\nVarious hadith, or traditions, are preserved about the attributes of ad-Dajjal like the following:\\n\\n1.He will be physically misshapen, and have one eye. There will be skin covering the area where the other eye is supposed to be .\\n2.He will deceive the faithful, teaching them that Heaven is Hell and vice versa. \\n3.He will have the power to work miracles in order to mislead believers. \\n4.He will try to put Man on God's throne. \\n5.He will have the Arabic letters kaf, fa and ra (kafir) -meaning unbeliever- branded on his forehead. \\n6.He will have the ability to revive the dead, and consequently claim to be God. \\n7.Some traditions of Islam relate that he will appear at Isfahan, and that he will rally the Isfahan Jews and many women to his support.\\nThe Prophet Muhammad asked his followers to recite the first and last ten verses of Chapter 'The Cave' as protection from the Dajjal. These verses deal with the beliefs and activities of the Christian nations. He also taught his followers to pray, "O Allah! I seek refuge in Thee from the trial of the Dajjal." He also said, There is no tribulation greater than that of the Dajjal from the creation of Adam to the day of resurrection.\\nThe occurrence of the Dajjal will correspond with the appearance of the Imam Mahdi, who will rally the faithful on earth to oppose him. Eventually, Isa (the name of Jesus in Arabic) will return from Heaven and slay the Dajjal. According to many interpretations this will occur near The Gate of Ludd (ancient city of Lydda) [1]. This will be followed by a Golden Age for Islam (not to be confused with the separate Islamic Golden Age) in which there are only true believers and almost everyone converts to Islam. Eventually decline will set in and by the will of Allah the End will come for Man. This is similar to a retelling of the Christian apocalypse where the end comes with the return of Jesus and Judgment Day.\\nHe is mentioned in Chapter 16 of "The Arabian Nights": "Sinbad Voyage 1" or "First Voyage"\\n\\n"Also to while away the time of waiting I explored a little island named Cassel, which belonged to King Mihrage, and which was supposed to be inhabited by a spirit named Deggial. Indeed, the sailors assured me that often at night the playing of timbals could be heard upon it."

My experience says yes. My former wife is a nurse and they gave free flu shots for family members at her hospital.

But maybe it was just a coincidence.
Hiccups are gulping sounds caused by involuntary spasms of the diaphragm. The diaphragm is the muscle that separates the chest and abdomen and helps with breathing. Hiccups can be triggered if you eat too much or too fast, consume very hot or cold foods and beverages, or drink carbonated beverages. Other causes include cold showers, entering or leaving a hot or cold room, sudden excitement, and stress. \\nHiccups are not a serious medical condition and usually disappear on their own within a few minutes. If they last longer than 24 hours, hiccups may be a sign of another condition or injury. You should see your health care provider if you experience prolonged hiccuping. \\n\\nHome remedies are usually the primary treatment for hiccups, although no one is really sure how well they work. Hiccup home remedies include sneezing, being suddenly frightened, holding your breath, gargling, drinking pineapple juice, drinking water rapidly, sipping ice water, or swallowing dry granulated sugar. These activities may help by altering breathing patterns.

You need 2 lights to get contrast.  Set one at 10 O'clock and one at 7 o'clock.  Put a difuser (white paper) in front of the 7 o'clock lite (you want half the light from that one).  Use a background with a single strong color (not the same as the product) that you can select in Photoshop to delete out the background.  Support the product on a rod (stick it on using putty) that is behind the product so it does not show.  Keep the background as far away as possible and use as large an f stop as you can while keeping the whole product in focus.  That's about it!

The question can best be answered by stating that John penned the book of Revelation, while our Lord Jesus is the Author.  The correct title of the book comes at the very beginning, "The Revelation of Jesus Christ."  John was shown what to write.  He received Revelation while imprisoned on the Isle of Patmos.\\n\\nThe strongest evidence for dating any ancient historical document is internal.  The second evidence is written tradition, a way of refering to non-scripture.  We know that unlike other apostles, John did not die a martyrs death.\\n\\nThe first history of the church, outside of the first century book of Acts (by Luke who also wrote Luke), was that of Eusebius in the 4th century.  Eusebius relates the story of John being carried to church in his old age, telling fellow Christians to love one another, for in that all was fulfilled.\\n\\nDates given for the writing vary, but scholars set a late date of being during the Roman Emperor Domitian's reign.  This is said to be about AD 95-96.  This is highly significant as it would be the very last "theopneustos" (God breathed) scripture written.\\n\\nIt is also significant, because the REVELATION OF JESUS CHRIST serves as the expounder and capstone of the prophetic writings.  It could be said that the most vital book to understanding Revelation is the book of Daniel, because this book is the only one which not only gives the events, but also the times (this is noted by Josephus in his description of Daniel).\\n\\nSince the author, our Lord Jesus, is eternal (Rev. 21:6), it could be said that His Revelation not only was written, but that it is and always has been written, and the book carries a great curse for whoever adds to it -- REVELATION ADDS ALL THE PLAGUES OF THE BOOK!!!  To those who take away -- IT SAYS GOD SHALL TAKE AWAY HIS PART OF THE BOOK OF LIFE, AND OUT OF THE HOLY CITY, AND FROM THE THINGS WHICH ARE WRITTEN IN THIS BOOK.\\n\\nYears ago, an old mentor of mine showed me a greek version of Revelation he had.  It showed the variants (places where somehow different manuscripts disagree).  Nevertheless, certain variants do not cast doubt upon the reliability of transmission.\\n\\nMy study of Revelation has revealed that a concordance, careful study, and reverence for Almighty God reveal the same exact themes found in varying scriptures, both old and new, (also helpful are the book of Enoch and also Yashir "Jasher").  Someone who is truly up to such a task shall find that only the Omniscient Creator could tie such a sweeping exposition of scripture into a dispersed narrative of the end of the age and the renewal of all things under Messiah.\\n\\nOur Lord Jesus Christ is the Author.  John wrote the book.\\n\\nI hope this helps.\\n\\nTake care,\\nMark

If you read the bible and believe what you see in print to be the 100% truth of earth and human history, then you have to believe that god made some others too in some lands not so far away, because we're told that Cain found a wife other than Eve with whom to sire some offsprings, or else, he did sex with a sister.  In that case we all would be descendant of incest.  Now, doesn't that just make you feel all warm and fuzzy!\\n\\nIf, indeed, god made some more people in some lands near and far away, we're told nothing about when it was done,  nor of anthing else concerning them.

You can only make Vitamin D by sunlight exposure on the skin, so the more skin that's exposed, the more vitamin D you make.  Also, in the summer, the skin is higher in the sky - you can more sunlight concentration on the areas of the skin that is exposed.\\n\\n5 minutes of summer sun in shorts would give you ample Vitamin D. In winter, depending on where you live and on how bright and clear the sunshine is and the amount of skin you have exposed, you might need 20 or 30 minutes a day.
The simplest answer is that it is not infinite, but undefined.\\n\\nThis is due to a simple reason - 0/0 gives different answers depending on which direction you come from.\\n\\nConsider the expression x/x, if you make x really, really small (but still greater than zero), you will be getting very close to 0/0, and your answer is always one.\\n\\nOK, now look at 2x/x - if you again make x really, really small (but still greater than zero), you will still be getting very close to 0/0, but now your answer is always two!\\n\\nThe problem is in the *vicinity* of 0/0, the numbers jump all over the place, and don't make a pattern. Any other choice of numerator and/or denominator will always result in a vacinity where the values are all around a single value. Mathematicians deal with this sort of uncertainty by saying that it is undefined.

OCD stands for obsessive compulsive disorder.  It has absolutely nothing to do with bipolar disorder.  Most people think that OCD only covers the repeditive completeing of tasks or paranoia, but actually there are many branches of OCD.  There are the checkers, who repeatedly check things such as whether or not the locked their cars, there are the cleaners, who are petrified of germs and compulsively clean everything, there are the 'moral nuts' who are constanly terrified of committing 'sins' and there are the pure obsessionals, who have unwanted violent thoughts concerning death, suicide, murder, or sexual activities.  These are only some versions of OCD, and everyone who has it has a slightly different condition.  No one is sure exactly what causes OCD, although it is believed to be an imballance of chemicals in the brain, and seems to be hereditary.  OCD is a very prevalent disorder, although most forms of it are mild, and almost all forms are manageable with the propper tools.

Muawiya was not the founder of Sunni denomination of Islam. (See below)\\n\\nWith 940 million adherents, Sunni Islam is the largest denomination of Islam. Followers of the Sunni tradition are known as Sunnis or Sunnites; they sometimes refer to themselves as Ahlus Sunnah wal-Jamaa'h, "adherents to the Sunnah and the assembly."\\n\\nSunnis have their historical roots in the majority group who followed Abu Bakr, an effective leader, as Muhammad's successor, instead of his cousin and son-in-law Ali. The Sunnis are so named because they believe themselves to follow the sunnah or "custom" of the Prophet.\\n\\nAlgeria has nearly 99% Sunni Muslims (Sunni Islam is the state religion), Kuwait has 70% and Afghanistan has a majority of Sunni muslims (around 80%). Sunni Muslims also outnumber Shi'ite Muslims in Israel, Egypt, Turkey, Somalia, Uzbekistan, Sudan (70%), Syria (80%), Tajikistan (85%), Libya (97%), Jordan (92%) and certain islands like the Maldives, Comoros (98%) and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands (80%). Iraq has 45-60% of Sunni Muslims, who are concentrated mostly in the central & northern parts of the country. Sunni Muslims are a minority in Iran (10%) and Bahrain (30%).\\n\\nSunnis base their religion on the Quran and the Sunnah as understood by the majoroty of the community under the structure of the four schools of thought. The four Sunni schools of law (madhahib) - the Hanafi, the Maliki, the Shafi'i and the Hanbali - are sometimes mistakenly understood as different sects, but they are not. These four schools of religious law associate themselves with four great scholars of early Islam: Abu Haneefah, Malik, Shafi'i, and Ahmad bin Hanbal. These scholars were known for their knowledge and piety throughout the Muslim world. They differed only in minor issues of application of certain principles in the religion and were not in opposition to each other. In fact, Ahmad bin Hanbal was a student of Shafi'i, who was a student of Malik.\\n\\nSufism is considered by the majority of Sunnis to be integral part of Sunni Islam. It deals with the spiritual aspects of a Sunni Muslim's everyday life. Some of the most famous Sufi schools are the Qadiri, Naqshbandi, Shadhili, Chishti, and Rifa‘i paths or tariqas.\\n\\nSunnis view the Shi'ites as from the ahlul-bidah; i.e., the people of innovation. Sunnis oppose Shi'ite beliefs concerning some of the companions of the Prophet, the belief in the Imamate and difference on the Caliphate, and others. Other groups considered to be outside Islam by Sunnis are Nation of Islam, Ahmadiyya, and Ismailis.\\n\\nShia Islam includes most of the Muslims that are not counted among the Sunni. The primary division within Islam, between Sunni and Shi'a, dates to the death of the Prophet Muhammad when his followers were faced with the decision of who would be his successor as the leader of Islam. Shi'ites are those who followed Ali, the closest relative of Muhammad, as Muhammad's successor. Today there are approximately 120 million Shi'ite Muslims in the world.\\n\\nThe Shia consist of one major school of thought known as the Jafaryia or the "Twelvers," and a few minor schools of thought, as the "Seveners" or the "Fivers." These names all refer to the number of imams they recognize after the death of Muhammad. The term Shi'a is usually meant to be synonymous with the Jafaryia/Twelvers.\\n\\nThe Origins of the Sunni/Shia split in Islam\\nAli is the central figure at the origin of the Shia / Sunni split which occurred in the decades immediately following the death of the Prophet in 632. Sunnis regard Ali as the fourth and last of the "rightly guided caliphs" (successors to Mohammed (pbuh) as leader of the Muslims) following on from Abu Bakr 632-634, Umar 634-644 and Uthman 644-656. Shias feel that Ali should have been the first caliph and that the caliphate should pass down only to direct descendants of Mohammed (pbuh

Well, now these damn fools are blowing up mosques. That is bound to start a civil war and that is just what the insurgents are hoping they will do.  Our guys should just return to base and let the Shiites and the Sunnis duke it out.  Once the killing spree is over they should give an ultimatum to whoever is left.  Form a secular government or we're going home. Religion is the biggest nemises in Iraq.  It clouds every issue brought to the table.  Unless these bone heads wake up and realize this, they will never resolve their differences.  And that is the good news from Iraq!
Ok you need to study in small sessions, and anything most important right before you go to bed. Study for 20-30 minutes, take a 10 minutes break, 20-30 minutes, 10 minute break. Studies show this helps the brain most. Also, study actively. For example, don't just read over something, make a game out of it, or have someone quiz you on it.  Always get 8 hours of sleep, eat healthy foods and plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables, and make sure you start studying at least 1.5-2 weeks before your exams. Make little notecards so you can quiz yourself in those odd moments like on the bus or in line at the store or where ever. If you also re-write key concepts, that helps your brain remember them better. Even if you have a scantron test, know the concept well enough to write an essay so that you are more prepared than you need to be.

Once per year digital rectal exams and PSA tests are the most effective preliminary means to detect prostate cancer. \\n\\nIf you the doctor feels something during the DRE then further tests may follow. If you PSA is high, usually above 3.6, then further testing is warranted. If your PSA is below 3.6, but has risen by .75 per year, then additional tests may follow.\\n\\nIf one of the above conditions arises then you may be asked to see a urlogist who will want to do a biopsy. Ask for an fPSA (free PSA) test first. If you 'free' PSA level is below 20% by all means have the biopsy. If the free PSA is above 20%, and the doctor did not feel an irregularity, you might consider waiting and watching for 6 months to a year. \\n\\nOtherwise a biopsy where the doctor takes at least 10 samples should be done. Since this is invasive, but not painful, the biopsy should be the last resort to finish your testing for cancer.\\n\\nIf the lab determines you have a cancer, then send the lab results to another private lab to have the results confirmed, before you starting treating your cancer.\\n\\nThe best labs in the country are..\\n\\nThe Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions\\nAnatomic Pathology Consultation Service\\n401 N.

MySQL is a popular open source SQL (Structured Query Language) database implementation, available for many platforms, including Windows, Unix/Linux and Mac OS X.\\n\\nMySQL is a relational database management system, which means it stores data in separate tables rather than putting all the data in one big area. This adds flexibility, as well as speed. The SQL part of MySQL stands for "Structured Query Language," which is the most common language used to access databases. The MySQL database server is the most popular open source database in the world. It is extremely fast and easy to customize, due to its architecture. Extensive reuse of code within the software, along with a minimalist approach to producing features with lots of functionality, gives MySQL unmatched speed, compactness, stability, and ease of deployment. Their unique separation of the core server from the storage engine makes it possible to run with very strict control, or with ultra fast disk access, whichever is more appropriate for the situation.

When an object (or disturbance) moves faster than the information about it can be propagated into the surrounding fluid, fluid near the disturbance cannot react or "get out of the way" before the disturbance arrives. In a shock wave the properties of the fluid(density, pressure, temperature, velocity, Mach number) change almost instantaneously. Measurements of the thickness of shock waves have resulted in values approximately one order of magnitude greater than the mean free path of the gas investigated.\\n\\nShock waves are not sound waves; a shock wave takes the form of a very sharp change in the gas properties on the order of micro-meters in thickness. Shock waves in air are heard as a loud "crack" or "snap" noise. Over time a shock wave can change from a nonlinear wave into a linear wave, degenerating into a conventional sound wave as it heats the air and loses energy. The sound wave is heard as the familiar "thud" or "thump" of a sonic boom, commonly created by the supersonic flight of aircraft.\\n\\nEveryone's familiar with the sonic boom from passing jets - that's a shock wave - but so is a balloon popping!  Interesting, huh?

A bipolar disorder is also known as a maniac disorder. \\n\\nThis is a very dangerous phycholigical sickness in which a person can go completely nuts. That person may not only stop caring for their personal needs, but could also become dangerous to themselves,(could committ suicide), or dangerous to others around them,(could kill someone), if early treatment is not provided.\\n\\nIf you know someone with this disease, you should consult a psychologist immediately before its too late. A person with this disease could lead a normal life with proper medication and regular visit to their psychologist. If treatment is not provided for a long time,then there is also a risk of the patient going nuts forever

Respiratory rate is in part controlled by the person's overall metabolic rate.  All of the body metabolic processes impact each other.  Breathing can and does change if you body becomes acidic or basic.\\n\\nBoth breathing and metabolism slow with age as the body goes through normal changes. This is the same reason that a 20 year old can eat 3500 Calories of food and not gain weight.  The same person at age 45 would likely have a slower metabolism and if they could eat that much would likely gain a lot of weight.
God. (cheating) This explanation is what everyone eventually resorts to when the other answers fail. Now, before I go any further, I should make clear that I'm not talking about any of the gods defined in various religions. Throughout all of human history, we've been trying to explain existence. But nobody has ever succeeded. And it's likely that nobody ever will. So we create the concept of God, whose only necessary property is being "that which explains existence." \\n\\nThis doesn't tell us much about god, though. It doesn't mean that any particular religion is correct. It merely defines god as something which answers The Question, because we have not been able to.

Since the government controls the internet in China, Yahoo (& Google) block those sites so they can still get traffic from China - since China has the largest population, they feel it is too much of a risk to be COMPLETELY blocked. So, they block a few sites, they continue getting those important "hits" to their web counters, the Chinese government censors "subversive" material and the only loser is the Chinese web surfer.
For preparation:  Continue to make good grades, and don't get wrapped up in high school drama.  No college wants to admit a delinquent.  Play a sport if you can, participate in clubs or other activities.  If nothing else, volunteer. \\n\\nAs for choosing a college, you definitely need to start thinking about this already if you are 16.  You could organize yourself by making a few lists. \\n\\nFirst, write down everything that you HAVE to have in a college.  Ex:  public or private, small or large, urban or rural, top tier school or don't care, price range, certain programs, your girlfriend goes there, etc.\\n\\nWrite down everything that you ABSOLUTELY do not want. Ex: same as above\\n\\nAfter this, do some research.  There are websites to help you, or you can go to the library or Barnes & Noble and look at the 2006 colleges and universities book.  \\n\\nAfter you pick out schools, make sure you have at least the following: \\n\\n1 safety school\\n1 favorite that you'll probably attend\\n1 favorite that is kind of a stretch\\n1 bigger stretch\\n\\nIf you're less of a risk-taker or can't afford that many, just have a favorite and a back-up safety school. \\n\\nKnow the SAT/ACT range needed for your schools of choice and retake the tests if necessary to hit close to the range. \\n\\nApply early!  Some colleges have "early decision" programs, where if you are accepted the fall of your senior year of HS.  Some colleges have rolling admissions, some make all of their decisions at one time. \\n\\nIf you need financial help, apply for government loans and research scholarships that are specific to your school.\\n\\nMost of all, just relax and stay organized.  College is a great time of your life!

The best thing to do for any resume is personalize each one you send for the specific job and company you are applying to.  You can check the company website (usually they will have a careers page) to try to find out more about what their interests and policies are regarding potential employees, and make the decision for each application. \\n\\nIn general, however, full disclosure is best, so if a company does check your transcripts, you will not be called into question.

There are so many "how's"  boy oh boy... One thing I can say is that you have to have patience.  You have to have it in your mind that you will work with it through the profitless times.  \\n\\nYou will need to have a "real" job in the mean time.  Because your bills will still keep coming even though your income won't. a huge percent of start up business lose money in the beginning. They say that the majority of them go under within the first 5 years.  If you can make it past that point you have a shot at keeping it going and actually haveing it be profitable.  I have my own business and It took about 2 (TWO) years before I got my FIRST order!!  I have now been in business for about 5 years and making money.  If I wanted to I could even have enough to do in order to hire employees.  But it took time.  \\n\\nThe second most important thing  - I must stress this - it is VERY important - YOU MUST HAVE SOMETHING THAT OTHERS WANT.   Wether it is a service or a product... if others don't want it you will NOT make a penny.  \\n\\nGood luck with it!!

First of all, figure out if it is a chemical inbalance or if you are bummed because of something in your life. For the first, go see a doctor. If you have already, read the book "the new feminine Brain" by Dr. Mona Lisa Schultz. If your life is not going as planned or you have had a lot of disappointments, see a therapist and figure out what is bugging you and learn to work through it. It is hard work, but if you want to get over your depression, which is a SYMPTOM of something else, you need to tackle the source. \\nI hope this helps. Best of luck to you.\\nFor minor blueness; exercise and do things for yourself (NOT shopping) by taking walks, reading, anything you REALLY enjoy for yourself.
Winter in Alaska lasts different amounts of time depending on the location.  In Anchorage, where I live, we see the first snowfall in late October or so.  Cold and snow here lasts through late April/early May when we experience Spring "break up"...when the snow melts and everything turns into a muddy mess.  Other parts of the state see their snowfall start earlier or later, depending on physical location in the state, proximity to the coastlines, etc.

Women and children are to be treated with the utmost respect according to the Koran (which is not a dirty book). The extremists misinterpret Mohammad's writings to meet their personal needs, just like Christian extremists misinterpret the Bible to meet their personal needs (regarding homosexuality for example). \\n\\nThe prisoners you're referring to have not yet been convicted of anything, and many have been released over the last 3 years because there was no evidence to hold them, which means there must be more that are being held without evidence as well. Until they're convicted of terrorism, they should be treated as we would want to be treated in that situation (think of the Americans that are kidnapped in Iraq -- we want them treated with respect).\\n\\nI don't understand why the Afghan government thinks it's ok to execute a man for converting to Christianity. That is not Mohammad's teachings. See the democratically elected government we helped put into place? Pretty similar to the Taliban, isn't it? God help them all.

In one year there are 365 days of 24 hours. Each hour has 60 minutes and each minute is 60 seconds long. So, 60s/min x 60min/hr x 24hr/day x 365days equals 31,536,000s. This many seconds is an even larger number than the number of miles light goes in one second! It would take you three years to get to number 31,536,000 if you could write one number per second for eight hours per day. This many miles means you could go back and forth across the United States over one thousand times! At 60 miles per hour it would take you 60 years! \\n\\nSo, we take these two very large numbers and multiply them together to see how many miles light can travel in one year. You can tell already that this is going to be huge! That number is 5,865,696,000,000. Working eight hours per day at a rate of one number per second it would take you two hundred thousand years to get to number 5,865,696,000,000! This gets you across the United States two billion times which at our average speed of 60 miles per hour, would take nine trillion years! \\n\\nNow that you know what the distance is that light travels in one year you can also know the distance between objects in the universe. The closest star to us is about four light years away. This means that it is 23,462,784,000,000 miles away. How about this: the edge of the universe is about 15 billion light years away from us! Can you even imagine how many miles away that is?
well  a tube in her lungs can mean several things. but it sounds she has had a rather difficult time.if she has problems with her lungs and there are unknown spots there abcesses it can be from many things,or a simple infection that settled in her lungs and her body isolated it and encapsulated the bug.\\nor it can be from a systemic wide organism\\nand it has simply gotten in enough places\\nher body can no longer control its spread.\\n  until they know what it is be content she is doing ok.\\nthey could be talking about doing a biopsy to see what it is,or chest tubes which you havent said if her lung has collasped.\\nthey could be talking on mechanical ventilation also,which is placing a tuber in her lungs to right at the carina so air can go into both lungs s she can breath easier.\\n or placing drainage tube into the abcess to drain it.\\n  so the bottom line is none is terrifcally major,except the illness its self.\\n  whether she has a bacterial infection in the lung or other reason, the major thing it sounds they are trying to control it and may have to let her rest on a ventilator till they can control the infection. saw on that they will give her medications and put her to sleep,and place a tube into her lungs and hook her up to a vent. they may keep her knocked out till they can treat the infection,and then get her back to breathing on her own.\\n  the next thing is is what kind of infection is it. there are bugs out there \\nthat are not good to get, so without sounding crude simply relax until they know what they are dealing with.\\n  some of the bugs can totally destroy parts of the lung,others simply get isolated and encapsalated by the body.\\n  so the trick is is to get a direct specimen of the critter,and then grow it in the lab and test what kills it,in order to know how to treat her.\\n oxygen isnt all that bad either,it is simply what the bug is and get samples in order to know how to treat it.\\n  if you wonder i do intensive care work,and tried to make things simple for easy understanding.\\nshe has an infection and she has become very sick and they dont know what to treat her with yet.\\n  so relax some, and support her.\\ndepending on what they find out will determine the rest.

Research into the origin of life is a limited field of research despite its profound impact on biology and human understanding of the natural world. Progress in this field is generally slow and sporadic, though it still draws the attention of many due to the gravity of the question being investigated. A few facts give insight into the conditions in which life may have emerged, but the mechanisms by which non-life became life are still elusive.\\n\\nFor the observed evolution of life on earth, see the timeline of life.\\n\\nResearch into the origin of life is the modern incarnation of the ancient concept of abiogenesis. Abiogenesis, in its most general sense, is the generation of life from non-living matter. The term is primarily used in the context of biology and the origin of life. Abiogenesis was long considered to be a very common occurrence until the Law of Biogenesis (omne vivum ex ovo or "all life from an egg") became firmly established in modern biology as a result of the work of Louis Pasteur.\\n\\nCharles Darwin in a letter to J.D. Hooker of February 1st 1871, made the suggestion that life may have begun in a "warm little pond, with all sorts of ammonia and phosphoric salts, lights, heat, electricity, etc. present, that a protein compound was chemically formed ready to undergo still more complex changes, at the present day such matter would be instantly devoured or absorbed, which would not have been the case before living creatures were formed." Thus, it is the presence of life itself, operating in an oxygen rich atmosphere, itself a product of life, which prevents "spontaneous generation" from occurring on Earth today.\\n\\nThis modern definition of abiogenesis is concerned with the formation of the simplest forms of life from primordial chemicals, in an environment regarded as similar to that at the time shortly after the formation of the Earth. This is significantly different from the concept of Aristotelian abiogenesis, which postulated the formation of complex organisms. This article reviews different hypotheses for modern abiogenetic processes that are currently under debate.\\n\\nThere is no truly "standard" model of the origin of life, however most currently accepted models build in one way or another upon a number of discoveries concerning the origin of molecular and cellular components for life, which are listed in a rough order of postulated emergence:\\n\\nPlausible pre-biotic conditions result in the creation of certain basic small molecules (monomers) of life, such as amino acids. This was demonstrated in the Urey-Miller experiment by Stanley L. Miller and Harold C. Urey in 1953. \\nPhospholipids (of an appropriate length) can spontaneously form lipid bilayers, one of the two basic components of a cell membrane. \\nThe polymerization of nucleotides into random RNA molecules might have resulted in self-replicating ribozymes (RNA world hypothesis). \\nSelection pressures for catalytic efficiency and diversity result in ribozymes which catalyse peptidyl transfer (hence formation of small proteins), since oligopeptides complex with RNA to form better catalysts. Thus the first ribosome is born, and protein synthesis becomes more prevalent. \\nProteins outcompete ribozymes in catalytic ability, and therefore become the dominant biopolymer. Nucleic acids are restricted to predominantly genomic use. \\nThe origin (see Origin of organic molecules) of the basic biomolecules, while not settled, is less controversial than the significance and order of steps 2 and 3. The basic inorganic chemicals from which life was formed are methane (CH4), ammonia (NH3), water (H2O), hydrogen sulfide (H2S), carbon dioxide (CO2), and phosphate (PO43-). As of 2004, no one has yet synthesized a "protocell" using basic components which has the necessary properties of life (the so-called "bottom-up-approach"). Without such a proof-of-principle, explanations have tended to be short on specifics
The amount of income necessitating a tax return filing depends on your filing status:\\nSingle: $9,450\\nMarried, joint return, both spouses over 65: $18,400\\nMarried, joint return, one spouse over 65: $17,400\\nMarried, separate return: $3,200\\nHead of Household: $11,750\\nWidow or Widower with dependent child: $14,200

Difficult question you post that could cause many to drop down a "knee jerk" answer.  First of course everyone will say that human life is of more value than any natural resource.  But think of all the people who'd die of cold in the winter without oil.  And the economics of high priced oil can leave millions out of work and in some really dire circumstances.  However it's the "in the long run" portion of your question that makes me say that war for oil is not worth it.  The correct thing to do, and I believe this with every fiber in my being, is to find ways around the problem of oil.  Capitalism is suppose to be the perfect system where if a resource is not quite as abundant as one would hope, and therefore more expensive, then the market will find a way around it.  New energies, conservation, etc.  The fact that the powerful in business and politics right now don't want to "waste" their money researching these things and would rather ride on others backs to fight for cheaper oil is idiotic.  \\nOn the bright side, the President mentioned this exact idea in his State of the Union Address.  Whether it was simple lip service or not remains to be seen.

In nature, living things evolve through changes in their DNA. In an animal like a chicken, DNA from a male sperm cell and a female ovum meet and combine to form a zygote -- the first cell of a new baby chicken. This first cell divides innumerable times to form all of the cells of the complete animal. In any animal, every cell contains exactly the same DNA, and that DNA comes from the zygote. \\n\\nChickens evolved from non-chickens through small changes caused by the mixing of male and female DNA or by mutations to the DNA that produced the zygote. These changes and mutations only have an effect at the point where a new zygote is created. That is, two non-chickens mated and the DNA in their new zygote contained the mutation(s) that produced the first true chicken. That one zygote cell divided to produce the first true chicken. \\n\\nPrior to that first true chicken zygote, there were only non-chickens. The zygote cell is the only place where DNA mutations could produce a new animal, and the zygote cell is housed in the chicken's egg. So, the egg must have come first.

Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a group of symptoms related to the menstrual cycle. PMS is linked to changes in the endocrine system, which produces hormones that control the menstrual cycle. Medical experts don't fully understand the chain of events that causes premenstrual symptoms to be severe in some women and not in others. The one direct cause that is known to affect some women is genetic: Many women with PMS have a close family member with a history of PMS.

Realistically it's up to you. Luckily the girls get the say in the relationship and kind of give the 'go' signal whenever they are ready. Whether it's making out, sex, whatever, you need to make sure that you're ready and emotionally mature enough to deal with the consequences. Also, sex is like Pandora's box. Once you start having it, you won't be stopping, in this relationship or otherwise. Do what's best for you. Be safe! ;)

Heptitis C is a disease of the liver, The hepatitis C virus (HCV) is one of the most important causes of chronic liver disease in the United States. It accounts for about 20 percent of acute viral hepatitis, 60 to 70 percent of chronic hepatitis, and 30 percent of cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease, and liver cancer. Almost 4 million Americans, or 1.8 percent of the U.S. population, have antibody to HCV (anti-HCV), indicating ongoing or previous infection with the virus. Hepatitis C causes an estimated 8,000 to 10,000 deaths annually in the United States.\\n\\nA distinct and major characteristic of hepatitis C is its tendency to cause chronic liver disease. At least 75 percent of patients with acute hepatitis C ultimately develop chronic infection, and most of these patients have accompanying chronic liver disease.\\n\\nChronic hepatitis C varies greatly in its course and outcome. At one end of the spectrum are patients who have no signs or symptoms of liver disease and completely normal levels of serum liver enzymes. Liver biopsy usually shows some degree of chronic hepatitis, but the degree of injury is usually mild, and the overall prognosis may be good. At the other end of the spectrum are patients with severe hepatitis C who have symptoms, HCV RNA in serum, and elevated serum liver enzymes, and who ultimately develop cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease. In the middle of the spectrum are many patients who have few or no symptoms, mild to moderate elevations in liver enzymes, and an uncertain prognosis. Researchers estimate that at least 20 percent of patients with chronic hepatitis C develop cirrhosis, a process that takes 10 to 20 years. After 20 to 40 years, a smaller percentage of patients with chronic disease develop liver cancer.\\n\\nChronic hepatitis C can cause cirrhosis, liver failure, and liver cancer. About 20 percent of patients develop cirrhosis within 10 to 20 years of the onset of infection. Liver failure from chronic hepatitis C is one of the most common reasons for liver transplants in the United States. Hepatitis C might be the most common cause of primary liver cancer in the developed world. In Italy, Spain, and Japan, at least half of liver cancers could be related to HCV. Men, alcoholics, patients with cirrhosis, people over age 40, and those infected for 20 to 40 years are more likely to develop HCV-related liver cancer.\\n\\nRisk Factors and Transmission\\n\\nHCV is spread primarily by contact with blood and blood products. Blood transfusions and the use of shared, unsterilized, or poorly sterilized needles and syringes have been the main causes of the spread of HCV in the United States. With the introduction in 1991 of routine blood screening for HCV antibody and improvements in the test in mid-1992, transfusion-related hepatitis C has virtually disappeared. At present, injection drug use is the most common risk factor for contracting the disease. However, many patients acquire hepatitis C without any known exposure to blood or to drug use.\\n\\nThe major high-risk groups for hepatitis C are:\\n\\nPeople who had blood transfusions before June 1992, when sensitive tests for anti-HCV were introduced for blood screening. \\nPeople who have frequent exposure to blood products. These include patients with hemophilia, solid-organ transplants, chronic renal failure, or cancer requiring chemotherapy. \\nHealth care workers who suffer needle-stick accidents \\nInjection drug users, including those who used drugs briefly many years ago \\nInfants born to HCV-infected mothers \\nOther groups who appear to be at slightly increased risk for hepatitis C are:\\n\\nPeople with high-risk sexual behavior, multiple partners, and sexually transmitted diseases \\nPeople who use cocaine, particularly with intranasal administration, using shared equipment \\nMaternal-Infant Transmission\\n\\nMaternal-infant transmission is not common. In most studies, only 5 percent of infants born to infected women become infected. The disease in newborns is u

What you want to do is ask your service Provider if they host an internet service for your model of phone. If yes, be sure to ask what features are included so that you don't needlessly spend money. If no, ask if you can upgrade to a phone that is capable of the features you are looking for. It may be free, it may not.
You need to plates and a dielectric.  The dielectric can be air, and a lot of variable capacitors use air and change the capacitance by moving the plates and thus changing the amount of area overlapped by the plates.\\n\\nIf you want to be able to store a lot of energy, you need to use different dielctrics and materials for the plates.  To increase the capacitance, you have to either increase the surface area of the plates or use a dielectric material with a high dielectric constant.  \\n\\nIn aluminum capacitors, the plates are made of aluminum and the surface area is increased by using solutions that cause tunnels to form inside aluminum foil. This can increase the surface area over 100 times.  The dielectric is formed by growing an oxide layer on top of the aluminum which is very thin (microns).  \\n\\nIn tantalum capacitor, one of the plates called the anode is formed from tantalum by taking tantalum powder, pressing it into a pellet, and sintering (or partially fusing) the tantalum particles together in a furnace.  This makes a solid pellet with a lot of pores, and so it has a very high suface area. A tantalum wire is either pressed with the pellet or welded later to form one of the terminations in the finished capacitor. Tantalum oxide can then be grown on to of the tantalum to form the dielectric.  The other plate, called the cathode, is formed by dipping this pellet into manganese dioxide solutions.  The manganese dioxide is able to penetrate the pores and cover much of the surface area on top of the dielectric.  It is then dipped into a carbon paint solution and cured, and the carbon layer efficiently contacts the manganese dioxide layer and protects the sensitive dielectic layer from the next layer, the silver layer which is also normally applied by dipping the pellet into a paint and curing.  The robustness of the silver layer and its excellent conductivity is needed beacause a second termination is attached to it.  This assembly is covered with epoxy to protect it from mechanical stresses, but the terminations remain partially exposed to allow for attaching to a circuit board.

Stay away from payday lenders at all costs.... or it will end up costing you a bundle.  It sounds like such a simple thing, and their ads make them sound like they're really there for you when you need them.  But don't be swayed.  They charge incredibly ridiculous rates of interest, and if you're not careful, you can wind up in a vicious cycle with them.  Here's how:  you borrow $100 till next payday.  Then your paycheck arrives, but you don't have an extra $100 to pay back the loan.  They offer to roll it over for you.  Then you decide to take out another $50 just to get you by till next payday.  Now you owe $150 plus a whole ton of interest.  Oh yeah, and fees too.  \\n\\nSo what's a person to do if you're tight on cash?  Talk to your credit union or bank.  See about alternatives they have to payday loans.  Even opening a credit card will charge you less interest than using a payday lender.  \\n\\nThen, take a good hard look in the mirror and figure out how to cut expenses so you aren't strapped for cash.  Perhaps you could get a 2nd job for awhile to bring in some additional money.

Hello, \\n\\nHere are some strong reason's you should consider upgrading to XP. \\n\\nStability. Windows XP has the ability to run a large number of apps without running out of resources, without crashing. (If you're running Windows 2000, you already have this, so there's no gain. \\nSecurity. This is a huge topic that I can't adequately cover in a few sentences suffice to say that security of your data and your privacy in Windows XP is leaps and bounds beyond anything available in Windows 9x. (Again, if you have Windows 2000, you already have most of the security capabilities of Windows XP.) \\nUI enhancements. A variety of changes in Start menu, taskbar, Windows Explorer, and Control Panel make everyday tasks such as launching programs, switching between windows, and managing files just a little bit faster, easier, and more convenient. These features can each be customized, so you can use the ones you like and change others back to Windows 9x/2000 style. (Similarly, you can banish the new look of Windows XP while still enjoying its other benefits.) \\nFast User Switching. Great for shared computers, FUS lets someone else log on without requiring you to first close all your documents and applications. \\nPower management. Standby and hibernation let me save power (on desktop PCs as well as portables) yet still have fast boot time, bringing me right back to where I left off. (That is, all the windows that I left open when the system powers down are already open when I power up.) \\nDigital photo support. I was never a fan of digital photography until I got XP because it was such a hassle before. But the support for cameras and scanners, as well as the features built in to Windows Explorer for viewing, printing, e-mailing, and manipulating images have actually made it fun and practical to work with photos in new ways. \\nRemote Assistance. The ability to actually see and work with someone else's screen while conversing with them through text, voice, and video chat is a killer feature for anyone who's looked upon as a computer guru and gets calls for support from relatives, friends, and neighbors. (I suspect that includes most PIBMUG members!) \\nRemote Desktop. The ability to connect with my home computer from the office (or vice versa) is awesome. It looks and acts exactly as if I'm at that computer five miles away, and I have access to all its files, printers, and other resources. And like remote assistance, it's acceptably fast if you have broadband Internet access. I also use it to work with other computers on my own LAN that's sometimes easier than hopping back and forth between two computers. \\nBetter help. It's easier to navigate, integrates information from the Microsoft Knowledge Base, and includes links to a number of diagnostic tools. \\n\\nPlease see here for more http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=why+upgrade+from+windows+2000+to+XP&prssweb=Search&ei=UTF-8&fr=FP-tab-web-t&fl=0&x=wrt \\n\\nhttp://www.windowsusers.org/whyupgrade.html

I am now trying to ask diverse questions to get into the leaderboard. \\nThanks & Take Care

And also thank you for the points on the "should I say yes" question - I am happy for you!\\n\\nI thought about your question overnight, and I came up with a simple answer, although I don't know if it is applicable in your case.\\n\\nThe gift - a camera, film and an album. You are going to be spending time in one of the most zoologically rich areas in the world, on a time of great importance to your relationship. A camera will allow you to capture these memories along with photos of the two of you to keep.\\n\\nKinda corny I know, but I think that I would like it.

Monetization of a blog can be rough.  The first thing you have to do is decide on the types of ads you want to display and then look at availible networks.

Because people frequently go into a doctor's office complaining and get really upset if the doctor doesn't do something for their cold. Doctor's like to make money and they only make money if they have patients who are happy. Therefore, they prescribe antibiotics just to make sure their patients are satisfied.
The Egyptian pyramids were built using an enormous labour force - ordinary citizens served for a few months of each year to work as well as full time craftsmen who worked to build the monuments.  Typically, a king began construction of his pyramid complex soon after ascending the throne and construction continued until his death.\\nThe earliest pyramids were solid stone structures.  After a sight was selected and prepared, the foundation was laid with large blocks being dragged in on sledges - a sort of sled-like vehicle.  As the pyramid rose, a ramp was used to move blocks into place higher up the structure.  Frequently, local stone was used for the interior blocks of the pyramid and finer stone was brought from special sources for the exterior casing of the pyramid.\\nIn later pyramids, the core was frequently not of solid stone but of rubble or mudbrick with an outer facing of nicer stone.  Eventually pyramids were constructed primarily of mudbrick rather than stone.
Typing in all caps is the online equivalent to yelling, and therefore bad manners. All caps are also harder to read. Here's why...\\n\\nOnce we have mastered reading (not sounding out words letter by letter), we recognize words by their shape rather than by the order of the letters. Think about it...you read whole words, not individual letters. When words are typed in all caps, they lose their shape -- that is, they become rectangular. The reader has to revert to reading them one letter at a time, hence slowing them down.\\n\\nGraphics designers use this as a tool to draw attention by slowing down a reader. It is an effective tool when used properly.
try setting off bug bombs, be sure to open all closet and cabinet doors, dresser drawers, medicine chests etc... this will result in having to do alot of laundry and dishes, but living roach free will be worth it. Also, keeping dishes done, and food crumbs and spills cleaned up will help keep them from returning. You could also set out boaric acid, it kills roaches too.  If after all this you still have roaches, you may have to call a professional. Good Luck, I hate roaches.

Don't worry about your voice it will get deeper later on. I think the best thing you can do to court a girl is to give her flowers. A single red (or if you know her favorite color then use that) rose makes quite a statement. Have you told her you like her? Don't stress about it just be yourself and take it slow. Ask her out and when you pick her up have some flowers ready. If she likes stuffed animals you can give her little stuffed animals after you've had a couple of dates. It's really not hard. Don't buy her really expensive things untill you get very serious. Be polite and respectful and complement her on the things she wears and even her perfume if she wears any. After you get serious you can send flowers to her work or her school. Girls like public displays of affection. I hope that helps hun, and if it doesn't than there are plenty of other girls that will love it!

We are too proud to accept that a "scientific advance" is just for the sake of doing it so...  we have to give a purpose.

A voiding cystourethrogram is an x-ray image of the bladder and urethra during urination.\\n\\nThis test is performed to detect abnormalities of the bladder and the urethra. The test may also detect abnormal bladder emptying or any congenital abnormality. In males, it may detect urethral stricture and the extent of narrowing in the prostatic urethra.\\n\\nX-rays are a form of electromagnetic radiation like light, but of higher energy, so they penetrate the body to form an image on film. Structures that are dense (such as bone) will appear white, air will be black, and other structures will be shades of gray\\n\\nUsually, the urinary bladder does not show up well on conventional x-rays. In this examination, a contrast medium is introduced into the bladder to improve visualization.\\n\\nX-ray images are taken in various positions with the bladder full of contrast and while the bladder is being emptied.

This is kind of funny but I answered the same question for my female friend less then two days ago because she had the same issue, same problem! I researched it for her as a medic that likes to study gyn and here's your answer: The surge of hormones in your body causes your endometrium (lining of the uterus) to become extremely thick and then fissure and crack (so to speak) at your fourth week and then to fold and flush out of your body(menses). When you take the pill it enforces a state of pregnancy on the body and causes your endometrium to thicken and stay thickened so that you cannot become pregnant because your body already thinks that it is. So when your on it for three days or more esp. right after your period your endometrium starts to thicken again rapidly due to the surge of hormones the pill is providing, but then you suddenly come off and your body is like what the hec!?! I need to flush my lining again but it's not thick enough for a complete mense so it just releases the little that it's built up by infrequent spotting till the lining goes back to ex nhilo, or the beginning of a fresh cycle. So it's really nothing to worry about at all unless you starting cramping terribly and have spotting into the two week range. Then you should see your gyno. I hope I covered everything if I missed something post an additional detail and I'll do my best to answer it.

People naturally sleep better in a cold room or when the body becomes suddenly cold. This is due to part of your circadian rhythm. In addition to sleep naturally being effected by light (your internal clock, the superchiasmatic nucleus, is located near the optic chiasm where the optic nerves cross); most humans will wake easier by the light of the sun and sleep easier in the dark, there is also sleep regulation based on body temperature. \\n\\nThe human core body temperature changes slightly throughout a day. At around 3 AM the body temperature is at its lowest. It starts to rise until near noon when it plateus and even dips a little bit (this results in people getting tired around lunch time...not because of the lunch itself, after all, you don't get tired after eating breakfast or dinner). Many populations, such as Mexico, take into account this normal fatigue and allow workers to nap (siesta) around that time. Afternoon the body starts rising in temperature again until around 8 PM when it begins to fall again overnight.

Snopes - the Urban Legend Archive - is a wealth of information on these things. Here's what they have to say:\\n\\n"The figure behind the curtains is a "standee" (a stand-up cardboard cutout used for advertising displays) of Ted Danson, dressed in a top hat, white shirt, and tails. The standee prop was created as part of a story line involving a dog food commercial in which Danson's character (an actor) appears, but references to the figure were cut from the finished version of the film."\\n\\n"(The standee shows up once more in the film: Ted Danson is standing next to it when the baby's mother comes to reclaim her child.) The figure was accidentally left in front of a window on the set by a propman and thereby "sneaked" into the background of one scene. Additionally, all indoor scenes were shot on a Toronto soundstage -- no real structures were used for interior filming."

I was in a long distance relationship at one point. We talked online, and on the phone all the time. Occasionally, we visited each other. Finally, he moved to my town to find a job but he could so I moved and left all my family back to his town. I was 18 at the time and he was 19. We got married and soon after I became pregnant. Before my son was born we moved back to my town thank goodness. Now, I have to tell you that we did not get to know each other good enough. We have a lot of problems to this day. Our lifestyles were so different. We've been married a little over a year now but have many problems. Just beware and get to know the person well before making any commitments.

One difference between a Bachelors and a Masters degree are the requirements. To gain eligibility for a Bachelors, you must have at least a GED and have scored well enough on the SAT. To be eligible for a Masters Degree, you must have completed a Bachelors degree program, and adequate scores on the GRE.\\n\\nIn addition, as a Bachelors degree student, your first year or two focuses on the acquisition of general knowledge and the last few years become more specialized, focusing primarily on classes for your major/minor area. \\n\\nIn contrast, the Master's degree program takes usually only 2 years to complete and the student is only focused on learning one speciality area during that time. In addition, a Masters program requires the student to be more of an independent learner, with classes requiring much more research and independent thought.

Checkmate (frequently shortened to mate) is a situation in chess (and in other boardgames of the chaturanga family) in which one player's king is under attack and there is no way to meet that threat; it is a check from which there is no escape. The king is never actually captured—the game ends as soon as the king is checkmated. A player who is checkmated loses the game. Delivering checkmate is the ultimate goal in chess (although not all games end in checkmate often a player resigns before checkmate is administered, or the game may end in a draw in several ways).

Rotaviruses are a genus of viruses belonging to the Reoviridae family. Seven major groups have been identified, three of which (groups A, B, and C) infect humans, with group A being the most common and widespread one. They cause vomiting and diarrhea and are the most common cause of severe diarrhea in children, killing about 600,000 children every year in developing countries (as of 2005). New vaccines have been shown to be safe and effective in 2006.
Yes and no. \\n\\nI don't believe that the good (or evil) done in this life will be revisited upon you in the next. There is no afterlife or reincarnation.\\n\\nHowever, I do think that people who do good things often see good things done to them and vice versa. This is not a hard rule. Plenty of people are terrible, yet enjoy wonderful lives. Many people are chronic do-gooders, yet suffer at every turn. However, I find that often a good deed is rewarded, if only by increasing the aggregate sense of happiness in the immediate vicinity.

There are two ways to make money from home in both industries. In medical transcription you have the choice of:\\n\\n1) Contracting with one of the many companies that will send you the work via a secured connection (high speed internet), you do process the work, send it back to them as directed and then you will be paid for the completed work.\\n\\n2) You can start your own medical transcription business, find your own clients to work with, process their workload and then get paid for the services that you rendered.\\n\\nIn medical billing there aren’t any legitimate companies that I know of that will hire or contract you to process their medical claims for them so the only option that you have is to start your own home based medical billing business/service.\\n\\nI do both medical billing and transcription from home and I own the businesses. I have never contracted with other companies to process their work because to me it’s just like working as an employee and we all know that to become financially secure you have to be owner of a thriving business not the hired help.\\n\\nThere are two resources that you should read because they are by experts within each field: \\n\\n1) "Step-By-Step Guide To Medical Transcription At Home". Michele Miller wrote this book and her advice can be found on every reputable medical transcription message board and forums. She has been in the business for years and is an expert on the topic of how to get involved in this industry so visit http://stelopm.mml461.hop.clickbank.net \\n\\n2) “Medical Billing Book For Beginners”. This book was written by Paul Hackett and he is know in the medical billing industry as “The Medical Billing Mastermind”. His book is being deemed as the “Bible” to starting a successful medical billing business so visit http://medicalbillingbook.tripod.com/

The best way to do this is by in every day conversation, try and not use these words.  I would imagine, you have to also determine what it is that sets you off, to where you get to the situation, where you use these words as well.  It's not going to happen tommorow.. or the next day, but as you search for other words to substitute the bad ones... it will become easier

Well, they go through sexual reproduction, and like the last guy said, they go into a mating ball.  However, its not always many males with females...that depends on the species. Sometimes its just one male and one female.  The male inserts his hemipene into the anal opening of the female and finding the vagina, releases sperm.
To be honest the only thing that you can do is just show him that you are there for him. Be yourself with him and show him what real love and affection is supposed to feel like. Only do this if you are really planning on being with him for a long time. You wouldn't want him to fall for you and grow attached to you and all of a sudden yu end upi breaking his heart. Right now just be a real good friend to him and tell him how you feel about him from time to time. And remember always keep it real!!! Be truthful about everything!! Being REAL really does count in the end.\\nGood Luck to you, and I hope that he gets over his heartbreak soon b/c heartbreak is the worst pain to have. BEEN THERE!!!

Health care providers, clinicians, and researchers have been debating the potential of antibiotics hindering the effectiveness of oral contraceptives for quite some time. There have been several research studies that concluded that some antibiotics do indeed decrease the effectiveness of the pill. Hence, it becomes more likely that an unintended pregnancy could occur. \\nThe general recommendation when taking antibiotics for a short amount of time is to use an additional backup contraceptive method such as a latex condom during the treatment time and for one week afterward. When taking antibiotics for a long period of time, the general recommendation is to use an additional backup method for the first two weeks of the antibiotic use. \\nIt also is important to remember that you should continue using the pill unless directed otherwise by your health care provider. He/she may provide more specific instructions based on your individual situation, medication, or health status.

Not really, men can have children much later in life than women.  Women know they only have a handful of years to have children, so they 'hear their biological clock ticking,' when they are getting close to the age when childbearing becomes difficult or impossible.  Men, on the other hand, can have children basically from puberty into their seventies and even eighties.

It the worst case, none of the 0's is in the correct place, so it will take 4 swaps to put them in the correct the first 4 slots of the array. That leaves you with 7 1s and 9 2s. It will take you 7 swaps to get the 1s into the correct positions. The worst case will look like: 11112222222221110000\\n\\nIn general if you have n objects in broken into subsets, it will take you minimum of n - (size of largest subset) exchanges to get them into position by swapping. Swap all the smaller subsets into position first, and the largest subset will end up in the correct position.

1. At the neuromuscular juncture, ACh released by the synaptic terminal binds to receptors on the sarcolemma.\\n\\n2. The resulting change in the transmembrane potential of the muscle fiber leads to the production of action petential that spreads across the entire surface of the muscle fiber and along the T tubules.\\n\\n3.The sarcoplasmic reticulum releases stored calcium ions, increasing the calcium concentration of the sarcoplasm in and around the sarcomeres.\\n\\n4. Calcium ions bind to triponin, producing a change in the orientation of the troponin-tropomyosin complex that exposes active sites on the thin filaments (actin). Cross-bridges form when myosin heads bind to the active sites on F actin.\\n\\n5. The contraction begins as repeated cycles of cross-bridge binding, pivoting, and detatchment occur, powered by the hydrolysis of ATP. These events produce filament sliding, and the muscle fiber shortens.

I think its usually because of sex.  Most times when you look at cheating situations its because the man doesn't feel he gets enough sex at home.

So if your ceremony actually will call your name, I don't think it would be so bad to attend.
The freezing point of a pure substance can be derived from a cooling curve plotting the temperature versus time.\\n\\nAs energy is taken out of a liquid, its temperature falls.  When the temperature reaches the freezing point of the substance, energy is taken out, but the temperature remains constant.  At this point, the cooling curve levels out this is quite evident when looking at the graph.\\n\\nThis leveling off effect is seen because in order for the substance to free, additional energy must be removed from the liquid, this is called the latent heat of fusion.  After the substance is frozen, the temperature of the solid can continue to drop.\\n{this same effect can also be seen as something melt, boils, condenses, or sublimes}

My answer is Xandros. I've personally tried around 15 linux distributions and I found Ubuntu, SuSE and Mandreva the best followed by Xandros, Debian, Fedora, Turbo and Whitebox. Well use any one of them cuz they're far more better than Linspire..So just keep using xandros or if u feel like trying any other distribution try ubuntu or suse ... best of luck.

wow,\\nThis world still is prejudice, although people say we've broken the barriers. Everyday I see people being descriminated at school,at work, in the grocery stores.I am hispanic,but my skin is dark like an African-American.

As thhe "air" in airplane implies, airplanes need air to fly.  Their engines are designed to take in air, mix it with fuel and combust it to produce energy for propellers or jet engine thrust.  Although many jetliners can operate at very high altitudes in thin air they can not operate within the near perfect vacuum of space with no air (oxygen) at all.  Also, airplanes are propelled through air using wings (air foils) that give the airplane lift and control.  There would be no lift or control within the vacuum of space.\\n\\nRockets and spacecraft on the other hand contain their own fuel and liquid oxygen (or other chemicals) that produce enormous thrust.  They can not "fly" in air although some can glide to return to earth.

In 2004, the State of Hawaii had signed an agreement with the NFL to keep the Pro Bowl in Hawaii until 2009 (at least). The NFL will control concessions, parking, souviners, and advertising at Aloha Stadium for the game. The game being in Hawaii is a win-win situation for the State of Hawaii and the NFL. Coming to Hawaii is an incentive for the players to make the all-star team, unlike the years before the game was moved to Aloha Stadium in Honolulu. Where would you rather play football in February, Hawaii or Wisconsin?

The wahhabis (sect of Islam) wear their trousers above their ankles. I am not sure why but I  think they believe thats how the prophet used to wear it.\\n  Most muslims prefer to wear their trousers in a normal way with the end of the trouser NOT touching the earth but just above 1 cm from the floor.\\n  Reason1: The floor is full of garbage and dirt and they dont want to dirty their clothes. Some things are considered unpure and thus they dont wan t it to touch their clothes like urine.\\n\\n  reason 2: Respect. There is more respect to a person dressed appropriately  and not like a hooligan dragging his pants everywhere and sweeping the floor with his trousers. \\n \\n  Reason 3: Because they were their trouser at the wasit line and not below the buttocks.\\n\\n  Reason 4: Its believed that Gays during the time of Prophet Lut (Lot) used to wear their clothes dragging it on the floor (like the trousers). So muslims dont want to do it that way.\\n\\n  Reason 5: Take the reason of gateway above mine. \\n         Thank yoou Gateway.
It depends on society.  In western cultures, generally 18 or older, preferably after being married.  In reality in these cultures, many have lost it in their teenage years to boyfriends/girlfriends.  In other cultures, women are married as young as 10 to men and lose their virginity then.  It is tradition and the way things are.  So it really varies depending on who you ask.  I lost mine at the age of 21 to a girlfriend.  When the time is right, you will know and that is when you will lose it.

You are just going to have to forget about it. He used you, and has the idea that you are easy since you gave it to him the first date. Sex on the first date is never a good idea, and now you know why. This doesn't make you a bad person, alot of girls fall into this and have to live with the consequences. And sometimes, the consequences are a lot more than the guy not calling (pregnancy & STDS) Learn from your mistake, and don't do it again. Be pickey about who you date too, guys talk and if his friends are under the impression that you are easy, it is likely that they will ask you out to try to get some too. Guys aren't looked poorly upon in general when they do something like this, there is a double standard, when they sleep around their friends think they are a stud, when a girl does it she is a whore. It's not fair, but that is the way it is.  So, if I were you I would not try to call him or seek him out in any way. He obviously got what he wanted and isn't interested, so he isn't worth your time or effort, and by calling him and chasing after him you are making him think that he is more than he is and makes you look desperate. Try to keep in mind that sex does not equal love.  Chin up, walk proud and learn from your mistakes. Good Luck:)

His office is legally responsible for doing an in-depth security review of all major company sales by foreign businesses.  They review the deals to ensure there are no legal or security concerns before the deal is allowed to go through.  If they run into any concerns they can take steps to mitigate the risks (such as ensuring no one will be placed into sensitive areas, background checks, rescoping the contract, etc...)  This is naturally done in private since we are talking about security concerns and big business deals that can affect the stock of said companies.\\n\\nIt is possible that his staff reviewed the deal and gave the go-ahead without his direct involvement and he is merely saying he trusts his staff: heck, he did pick a bunch of people who think exactly like him.  Regardless, after reviewing the facts it sounds like opposing the deal would be akin to prejudice.\\n\\nWe can't stop foreign companies from controlling american interests.  The company that is trying to take control of the ports (they will not be providing security mind you) does an excellent and professional job of managing other ports around the world.\\n\\nOf course I do enjoy watching the republicans rip apart Bush on the issue.  I imagine it will eventually blow over, it's just no one wants to look weak on security during an election year and there are few opprotunities to show that.

Have you tried mnemonics? it is a technique to improve memory, and it works great when you have to remember a lot of information. Just to give you an example, say you are studying the various parts of a cell and their functions:\\n\\nMITOCHONDRIA: site of aerobic respiration in eukaryotic cells it is a membrane bound organelle found in greater numbers in cells with high energy demands such as muscle. Made up of internal folds called cristae it is a double membraned organelle.\\n\\nLYSOSOME:  organelle which contains powerful digestive enzymes which are sometimes used in "cell suicide".  When energy flow to the membrane from the mitochondria is interrupted, the lysosome membrane ruptures releasing its contents resulting in the destruction of the cell. Found in protozoans, sperm and egg, thyroid cells, and leukocytes.\\n\\nNow, how will you remember their functions? Mnemonics means you associate words together to help you remember, or make up a silly/funny sentence that helps you or make up short forms. \\n\\nMy examples: \\nmitochondria - mighty (sounds similar) - energy\\nso these are related to producing energy\\n\\nlysosome - last days! (based on the sounds again, L and S) - suicide!\\nso this is related to the destruction of the cell\\n\\nHere's more detail:\\nMnemonic techniques are more specific memory aids. Many are based on the general memory strategies that were presented earlier. Although it can be easiest to remember those things that you understand well, sometimes you must rely on rote memory. The following techniques can be used to facilitate such memorization.\\nACRONYMS. You form acronyms by using each first letter from a group of words to form a new word. This is particularly useful when remembering words in a specified order. Acronyms are very common in ordinary language and in many fields. Some examples of common acronyms include NBA (National Basketball Associations), SCUBA (Self Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus), BTUs (British Thermal Units), and LASER (Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation). What other common acronyms can you think of? The memory techniques in this section, for example, can be rearranged to form the acronym "SCRAM" (Sentences/acrostics, Chunking, Rhymes & songs, Acronyms, and Method of loci).\\n\\nLet us suppose that you have to memorize the names of four kinds of fossils for your geology class: 1) actual remains, 2) Petrified, 3) Imprint, and 4) Molds or casts. Take the first letter of each item you are trying to remember: APIM. Then, arrange the letters so that the acronym resembles a word you are familiar with: PAIM or IMAP.\\n\\nSENTENCES/ACROSTICS. Like acronyms, you use the first letter of each word you are trying to remember. Instead of making a new word, though, you use the letters to make a sentence. Here are some examples:\\n\\nMy Dear Aunt Sally (mathematical order of operations: Multiply and Divide before you Add and Subtract) \\nKings Phil Came Over for the Genes Special (Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Genus, Species)
Yes.  They are on the team.
You have some slightly more specific questions?  You want *all* the facts?  If so, you'd end up with more facts than you could possibly understand, I suspect.\\n\\nAsk more specific questions and you'll get much better answers.  Otherwise, just google the heck out of lidar, radar, and laser and you'll learn probably more than you want to know.

If you are talking SHORT TERM, this two-week-long weight loss program will work. It has worked for me, for Renee Zellweger (after her Bridgett Jones movies) and for many others who need fast weight loss. Follow these steps religiously:\\n\\n1.Drink lots of fresh water every day using this formula: (your current weight) divided by 2 = ounces of water to consume each day. I like to drink room temperature water from a bottle because it’s easier to “chug.” I put four of the bottles on the kitchen counter and make sure they are all empty by the end of the day. Best to consume them throughout the day.\\n\\n2.Don’t drink any alcohol of caffeine. No soft drinks. Only green teas. REMEMBER, THIS IS ONLY 14 DAYS. YOU CAN DO IT IF YOU REALLY WANT YOUR GOAL.\\n\\n3.Fast walk or run for at least 60 minutes each day. It’s best to exercise in the morning since it will rev up your metabolism and keep our calorie-burn rate high throughout the day. You can do this by walking in place, using a treadmill, or walking outside. Whatever works for you.\\n\\n4.Do at least 50 crunches each day. I break mine into 2 or 3 different sessions. Also, if I need to do 20 crunches, I play a little trick with my mind and I “pretend” I am going to count to 25. It’s amazing how this helps the body get to all of the crunches with the same intensity.\\n\\n5.Eat only fresh vegetables! This is the key to the whole thing. Eat as many as you want, but DON’T eat any of the following: starchy vegetables including potatoes, squashes, pumpkins, and the like. They will work against you. Limit carrots, snow peas, and other veggies that are high in sugar content. NO GRAINS. Just fresh vegetables. You can eat salads, stir-fries, steamed, etc. But this is at the heart of your success.\\n\\n6.Don’t eat anything after 7:00 p.m.\\n\\n7.Put photographs (from magazines) up all over your house of trim, fit women. They will serve as motivators.\\n\\n8.Several times each day – especially when you first get up and when you go to bed, say something like: “I am enjoying my weight of (your goal weight).” Put it in the present tense and say it many times – with feeling! This will affect your subconscious mind to help you achieve your goal. Also, post these words in the same places where you post the photographs.\\n\\nAlso, don’t be surprised if you start feeling better than you have felt in a long time. You will have more energy, most aches and pains will be gone, and your whole body will look brighter. One warning, early on your elimination will be a little “urgent.” You may have some cramping. But this will all go away soon. Your body is in a deep cleanse.

Dogs don't think that way. You're projecting human thought patterns and behaviours onto animals, and that's simply not how their mind works. I read a great article about a month ago (I forget where) about an animal psychologist talking about this sort of thing, how a lot of problems with pets are caused by thinking about them in human terms. For example, one woman's dog started causing havok when she got a full-time job and left him home in the house. She thought he was angry at her, but that's not something dogs could even comprehend. No, it was rather that the dog was simply very confused and didn't understand what was going on, and figuring this out saved the dog from having to be put down (he almost bit someone).\\n\\nBasically, no. Chimpanzees and other such evolutionary cousins might, but your common house pets cannot think that way.

If you are in the United States and ship to India, you will be required by the Post Office to fill out PS Form 2976 Customs Declaration. In it, you will state the quantity and detailed description of the contents, weight and total value. The recipient on the other hand may pay custom duties on the item/s received depending on the rules of their postal services. \\n\\nSellers on eBay as well as other sellers anywhere on the Internet -- whether you use the post office, private shippers or customs brokers -- are all required to fill out the custom form when shipping to buyers. Ecommerce companies like Amazon and eBay sellers do not shoulder the custom duties for the buyer, as the buyer will have to pay for that. I know of Adsense publishers in England who received some techie gift goodies from Google last Christmas who were charged with duties on the items received. A buyer from the Philippines who purchases books from US-based Amazon may pay custom duties on the items received.\\n\\nMost of the small items that ship out are not inspected by customs, though there are countries (especially during holiday season) where they are more strict and inspect and open the packages received.\\n\\nHope this helps\\nIsabel Isidro\\nFor information on starting a business, visit http://www.powerhomebiz.com
Google bell jar and you find out lots about Sylvia Plath but not much about chemistry...\\nThe bell jar was probably not an invention in the usual sense of the word.  Bell jars were in use by alchemists in the middle ages (way before A. G. Bell), and may well date back much further.  Alchemy is believed to have started about 2000 BC in Egypt, although China, India and Arab cultures were also early practitioners.

I think the reason much is made of The Strokes is that they are an "authentic" rock and roll band.  When their first album came out in '99 - '00 the airwaves were saturated with the likes of boy and girl singers, who were just not rock and roll by any stretch.  I think the Strokes represented a true alternative to that.  Kind of like when Nirvana came and blew away the hair metal bands.  I think The Strokes did a similar thing (though by no means are they at Nirvana's level).\\n\\nAnyhow, I think they are stil taken seriously because their music is rock 'n' roll.  It's edgy.  And they are a really good live act.  Of course this is all my opinion.  But if you listen to their albums, you can judge for yourself.

The cop said "Shut up" NOT get up! The guy ran from them and was acting like a dangerous criminal and was treated like one. Not until later was the guy identified as a member of the armed forces.\\n\\n**MattDCNavy** He made no threatening moves? How about standing up after fleeing from the police (A felony) that’s not threatening?? How many times you ever been in a high speed chase and pulled a guy 2X your size out of a car? As for the power trip... I actually have to agree with you. But I want to add this... Police have to be different from most people (Same with Service members) when people are shooting or beating people or threaten to blow things up MOST NORMAL people run away. Cops & soldiers have to have the mindset to be able to run towards the situation. This causes us to maybe be alittle arrogant at times.

Organs - Small intestine \\n \\n \\n \\n       \\n \\n\\nSystem: Digestive\\n\\nLocation: Abdomen\\n\\nPhysical description: A five metre long narrow tube that hangs in sausage-like coils\\n\\nFunction: Chemical digestion of food and absorption of nutrients into your blood\\nLongest section of your digestive tract\\n\\nYour small intestine is around five metres long, making it the longest section of your digestive tract. Although it is longer than your large intestine it has a smaller diameter. This is why it's called the small intestine.\\n\\nChemical digestion\\n\\nAfter food is churned up in your stomach, a sphincter muscle at the end of your stomach opens to squirt small amounts of food into the top of your small intestine. This first section of the small intestine is called the duodenum.\\n\\nYour pancreas releases digestive juices through a duct into your duodenum. This fluid is rich in enzymes that break down fats, proteins and carbohydrates. It also contains sodium bicarbonate which neutralises acid produced in your stomach.\\n\\nYour gall bladder squeezes out bile down a duct into your duodenum. Bile helps break down fats in your food.\\n\\nPeristalsis\\n\\nDigesting food is pushed through the small intestine by peristalsis. Peristalsis is a muscular movement in which alternating waves of muscle contraction and relaxation cause food to be squeezed along the digestive tract.\\n\\nAbsorbing nutrients\\n\\nMost of the nutrients in the food you eat pass through the lining of your small intestine into your blood. The lining of the small intestine is covered in tiny microvilli. These are microscopic, finger-like protrusions which give the lining of the small intestine a massive surface area for absorption of nutrients to occur across. The microvilli give the inside of the intestine the look and feel of velvet.\\n\\nEach microvillus contains a minute blood capillary. When nutrients are absorbed into a microvillus, they enter its blood capillary. This is how nutrients from your food enter your blood.\\n\\nIndigestible food passes into the large intestine\\n\\nBy the time food leaves your small intestine all the nutrients in your food will have entered your bloodstream. All that remains is indigestible food which is passed from your small intestine to your large intestine for further processing.

I listened to DC Talk, Audio Adrenaline and Jars of Clay when I was a teen. A lot of people choose to listen to Christian artists because of their faith; they do not want to be "poisoned" by secular music. More power to you. Also, if the only reason you would not listen to such artists is because your friends think it is "lame", then you are no longer your own person (just like those anti-drug commercials...), don't lose your individuality. (I like Vanilla Ice...EVERYONE thinks his music is lame...guess what; I still rock out to Ice Ice Baby.)

So color you nails in a way that makes you happy and you'll be making him happy.

It is true you cannot preform any mental functions when you sneeze however when something is done so much that it becomes "habitual" such as walking it is not governed neccessarly by your mind.  It is then goverend by your nerves at your spinal column.  This is why you don't have to think about removing your hand from a hot stove...it never reaches your mind it is intercepted by your spinal cord and sent back to remove your hand.  When you sneeze it inturupts what your mind sends out but not neccessarily what your nervous system sends out to your body.  So it is possible to sneeze and walk.
maybe what rev. trask needs is a horn on his head, the guy is and idiot, i cannot imagine anyone wanting this person for their spiritual leader.\\n\\nDoes the Bible support the existence of unicorns, which are mentioned in some versions?\\n\\nThe King James, Douay, and other versions, mention unicorns. But that is not so with modern versions that accurately render the Hebrew.—Psalm 22:21; 29:6; 92:10 (21:22; 28:6; 91:11, Douay).\\n\\n“People once believed that the unicorn’s horn contained an antidote for poison, and during the Middle Ages, powders supposedly made from such horns sold for extremely high prices. Most scholars believe the image of the unicorn was derived from hearsay European accounts of the rhinoceros.” (The World Book Encyclopedia) Certain Assyrian and Babylonian monuments showed one-horned animals. These are now recognized as stags, ibex, cows, and bulls depicted from the side, a view that did not show both horns.\\n\\nTranslators were long uncertain as to what animal was meant. The Greek Septuagint rendered re´em´ with the sense ‘of one horn,’ or unicorn. The Latin Vulgate often translates it as “rhinoceros.” Other versions use ‘wild ox,’ ‘wild beasts,’ or ‘buffalo.’ Robert Young simply transliterates the Hebrew into English as “Reem,” basically leaving the reader in the dark.\\n\\nModern scholars, though, have eliminated much confusion over the re´em´. Lexicographers Ludwig Koehler and Walter Baumgartner show that it means “wild oxen,” with the scientific identification Bos primigenius. This is a “subfamily of the large horned ungulate family.” The New Encyclopædia Britannica explains:\\n\\n“Certain poetical passages of the Old Testament refer to a strong and splendid horned animal called re´em´. This word is translated ‘unicorn’ or ‘rhinoceros’ in many versions, but many modern translations prefer ‘wild ox’ (aurochs), which is the correct meaning of the Hebrew re´em´.”\\n\\nSince in current English “ox” has the sense of a castrated male, the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures consistently and correctly renders re´em´ “wild bull.” The aurochs (wild ox, or bull) seems to have become extinct by the 17th century, but scientists have deduced that it was quite different from the unicorn of legend. The ancient aurochs had a body height of about six feet [1.8 m], and a length of some ten feet [3 m]. It might weigh 2,000 pounds [900 kg], and each of its two horns could be over 30 inches [75 cm] long.\\n\\nThis certainly accords with the Biblical mention of the re´em´, or wild bull. It was noted for its strength and intractable disposition (Job 39:10, 11) as well as its swiftness. (Numbers 23:22; 24:8) Evidently it had two horns, not one horn like the legendary unicorn. Moses referred to its horns when illustrating the two powerful tribes that would spring from Joseph’s two sons.—Deuteronomy 33:17.\\n\\nSo the Bible does not support the idea of unicorns as renowned in legend. It does draw an accurate, though limited, picture of the massive and fear-inspiring aurochs, or wild bull, that existed in Biblical times and down into the not-too-distant past.\\n\\nNO UNICORNS, PROBABLY NOAH WAS WAITING FOR THE TURTLES TO GET ON BOARD
It's used for estimating fuel costs.\\n\\nEach town has an average number of heating degree days for the winter and average number of cooling degree days for the summer.\\n\\nWith those averages, you can calculate how long the air conditioner or heater will run for the year and then calculate the fuel costs.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou can calculate it from the average temperature each day.\\n\\nExample:\\nAverage temperature for Jan. 1 is 30°F.\\n65°F - 30°F = 35°F\\n\\nJan 1 is one day, so 35° difference * 1 day = 35 heating degree days\\n\\n\\nAverage temperature for Jan. 2 is 35°F.\\n65°F - 35°F = 30°F\\n\\nJan 2 is one day, so 30° difference * 1 day = 30 heating degree days\\n\\nYou do this for every of the year and add it up.\\n\\nJan 1 = 35 heating degree days\\nJan 2 = 30 heating degree days\\nJan 3 = \\nJan 4 = \\n\\nAdd it all up and you get the number of heating degree days for the winter.

Ninoguapo also didn't use a spell-checker!\\n\\nThe answer is 702. Here's how to get the answer.\\n\\nThe other way to say what this question is asking is this: If the school is 45% boys and 55% girls (which we know), then that means that the 858 girls are 55% of the total number in the school.\\n\\n"But," you say, "55% of WHAT????"\\n\\nYou can compare it using a ratio: 858 over "some magical unknown number" is the same as 55 over 100. So MULTIPLY 858 by 100, and then divide the answer by 55. That means the "magical unknown number" turns out to be 1,560...that's how many students there are in the school.\\n\\nTake out the girls (858) from the total (1,560) and you get...702. That's 45% of 1,560.

Abscence of thought is pure peace of mind. There is no other feeling quite like it. \\n I believe with a great deal of practice that you can control your thought pattern, so that no thought enters it for a short period. It is not easy, especially with the possibility of distraction. But it can be done and it centers you, you will feel more energy, having clearer thought process and many other benefits. This has been said to be a religion of sorts but that is not how I ever used it, I would use to just relax for myself not to give money to someone for a word to repeat to get to that state. Find one word , preferably single syllable and use that as your mantra. It usually has a meaning special only to you and how can anyone tell you that.\\nYou can slow down if not totally end the thought process for a short time with practice. It does not work for all but for some its a blessing.

My son has Cerebral Palsy specifically Spastic Assymetric Spastic Quadriparesis.  He just turned two and is now rolling over and sitting with out support.  He is learning to crawl.  He is still unable to bring himself to a sitting position or stand alone but he is making great progress now.  He has a ton of equipment to help him catch up his developmental milestones.  The best thing for your child is to realize he is not suffering from anything.  He has cerebral palsy.  My son is the happiest little boy I know.  I think it is harder on me than it is on him.  He knows nothing different...remember that.  You must be an advocate for him.  Be sure he is getting the max allowable physical and occupational therapy.  When the time is right he may need speech therapy as well.  The state provides some therapy usually for free.  Definately utilize whatever additional therapies your insurance will pay for.  When in doubt seek out a therapy clinic several specialize in children and talk to the owner.  They are often the greatest source of knowledge.  He/she will know most of the places you can seek help.  If you need just another mom to talk to while you are learning to deal with being the mom of a special needs child please email me.

He's not.  Kanye West was so stupid for saying that.  They told those people to EVACUATE New orleans.  The ones that stayed behind were just dumb.  Sorry to be mean, but it's true.

yes, a little girl that used to be in the house I grew up in. I saw her twice. Once in tattered rags for clothes and once in like a sunday dress. She actually saved me from falling out of a window when I was young. Her name was Elizebeth and my mom knows that she was murdered close by when the area used to be farmlands in the 1880s I think. It wasn't weird and she was very friendly, although there were some weird things. Like for instance, all the clocks in the house would stop on certain times, and my grandfathers clock (that wasn't wounds and was broken at the time) would randomly work and stop working. She didn't look faded or anything. It was like the little girl was alive.\\n\\nMy mother and I have also smelt smoke every once in a while. It's always weird because I'll start smelling the smoke and theres a kind of feeling. My mom's never led me on about whether my grandpa's spirit was there or not since she would only talk about it if I brought it up. \\n\\nI also think I've seen the outline of a suicide victim's ghost in my girlfriend's house. Long story, but it made me jump since it was so human like but black.

Coronary heart disease (CHD), also called coronary artery disease (CAD) and atherosclerotic heart disease, is the end result of the accumulation of atheromatous plaques within the walls of the arteries that supply the myocardium (the muscle of the heart). While the symptoms and signs of coronary heart disease are noted in the advanced state of disease, most individuals with coronary heart disease show no evidence of disease for decades as the disease progresses before the first onset of symptoms, often a "sudden" heart attack, finally arise. After decades of progression, some of these atheromatous plaques may rupture and (along with the activation of the blood clotting system) start limiting blood flow to the heart muscle. The disease is the most common cause of sudden death.
Aruba's currency is the guilder / florin denoted by the letters 'Awg.' but also widely known as 'Afl.' The official rate at which banks accept U.S. dollar banknotes is Awg. 1,77 and checks at Awg. 1,78. The rate of exchange granted by shops and hotels ranges from Awg. 1,75 to Awg. 1,80 per U.S. dollar. U.S. Dollars are widely accepted in Aruba, and banks may exchange other foreign currency.\\n\\nTraveler's checks are widely accepted and there is no charge for using them in hotels, restaurants and stores. Major credit cards are accepted at most establishments while personal checks are normally not accepted. \\n\\nThe Aruban florin is divided into 100 cents and there are coins of 5, 10, 25, 50 cents, 1 florin (100 cents) as well as the 5 florin coin. The square shaped 50 cent "yotin" coin is probably Aruba's best-known coin. \\n\\nBanknotes are issued in denominations of 10, 25, 50, 100 and 500 florins. Many souvenirs are made with the square 50 cent coin while the coin itself makes a unique gift for numismatic friends.\\n\\nCash may be obtained with MasterCard, Visa and American Express cards at credit card offices, banks, in some casinos and via Western Union. ATM cards and credit cards are accepted by ATMs of Aruba Bank, Banco di Caribe, RBTT Bank, and Caribbean Mercantile Bank. The card must have either a Cirrus or Visa Plus logo. ATM instructions are normally given in Dutch, English, Spanish and Papiamento. Cash is normally dispensed in local currency.\\n\\nTravelers with ATM cards bearing the CIRRUS, MAESTRO or Plus System network logos can withdraw cash in Aruban florins. Home bank accounts will be debited in dollars at a favorable exchange rate, and a 1% - 3% service charge will apply, depending on your credit card company. Before departing for Aruba, it's important to verify whether your PIN number will work in Aruba by calling 1-800-4-CIRRUS\\n\\nAruba is in the Atlantic Standard Time zone.

Some people think characters in anime/manga are hot because they are ideal. Meaning that if we, as human beings, could have the guy/girl of our dreams they would be like the characters from our favorite anime/manga. Unfortunatly this isn't good because if we only look to our dream guy/girl we will miss out on meeting a great guy/girl in real life. I personally crush on anime/manga characters but I don't let that close my eyes to the real life guy/girls around me. I use thoses crushes to write fanfics.

Because when it came out, there was nothing new and fresh that got children involved more in wanting to read and it filled that gap. It engages kids into using their imaginations more. It takes adults back to their younger years with the fantasy of it all. It's a good series that keeps growing and developing. Even though we've know from the begining that there would be only 7 books and ultimately a showdown between Harry & Voldemort, it's still interesting to see the unexpected twists and turns on the way to the end. It's just a GREAT series!
That depends, is it oil based or latex? Latex will rinse out at first, but if it is dry, you wanna get real hot water and soak it till the paint starts to come off, then launder, but don't dry in dryer til you are sure spot is out. Dryer will set the stain. If it is oil based paint, some thinner will get it out, but make sure as soon as you get the paint out, you wash out the thinner too. Either way, if you have already dryed it in dryer, you better fall in love with that stain, cause it's there to stay.

Length has nothing to do with the belts speed of course. Length only makes sure they reach all pulleys involved.

I have had and worn scaves amost of my life. Scarves were fashion until recently. This is what i found on a website noted in the sources section below.\\n\\n"a lost art...wearing headscarves...what today is sometimes called head wraps. Back in the 1950's, 60's, and early 70's, wearing headscarves was fashionable...even with teenage girls. So what happened? \\n\\nThree turns of fate...\\n\\nFirst, the Catholic Church stopped requiring that women cover their heads in church. Second, the carmakers stopped making convertibles (they make them again, but the damage is done). Finally (and worst of all), the Iranian takeover of the US Embassy (in Iran) in 1979. Headscarves were linked with religion again, but this time (in what Western countries perceived) in a negative way. Of course, there were changes in hairstyles and other factors, but these were the big three...particularly the last.  Of course, the September 11th attack and the war with Iraq has once again provided an unfair negative focus on headscarves."\\n\\nIn the Western world (except for the Catholic Church) the scarf was a fashion accessory, not religious clothing.

AC3 is normally a audio codec, primarily used in video files to encode the audio.   A direct quote from PCMag:\\n\\nDefinition of: AC-3 \\n\\n(Active Coding-3) Dolby's third digital audio coding technology based on a perceptual coding method. It is more advanced than AC-2 and provides six channels of audio in less space than two-channel stereo CD. AC-3 and "Dolby Digital" are synonymous. See Dolby Digital. \\n\\nThe control panel object should be a graphical front end to which ever AC3-decoder or encoder codec that's installed on your computer.  This control panel object should allow you to change various options associated with how AC3 works.\\n\\nDivx is a popular video compression that can utilize AC3 sound streams.  There are many other popular products that either use the AC3 decoder, or possibly even allow you to encode your sound files into the AC3 standard.  Creative Labs has such products.\\n\\nThe control panel object normally shows up when you install a product that uses one of the open-source AC3 decoders.  There may be commericial software that will install this object as well, of course.\\n\\nHope this helps a little.

Yes, I have vaginismus and am working on correcting it now. It is a condition where the the entry to the vagina tightens and causes pain when anything enters or touches it. I am still learning about it but I do know that it's only PARTLY psychological. My OB told me that its an actual condition. First and foremost if you speculate that your gf has this condition, do NOT have intercourse. It will make it worse! Second, she needs to see her OB. He will definitely be able to help. Mine prescribed lidocaine (which is a cream that numbs the skin) for me to use on myself. He said it is fixable but takes patience and work. He told me it could be up to 6 months before we have intercourse again. \\nMy advice to you would be to 1. Be patient, supportive, and understanding with her. It is extremely painful. So it's understand not to want to have sex, or even look forward to it.\\nI hope I helped!
The history of the abbreviation OK is not what you'd expect. Some think that it comes from the Chocktaw affirmative okeh, or the Greek olla kalla, or others. The truth is that in the 1830's in New England, initialisms were the fad. Much like TGIF and FYI in modern times, in fact. The craze even went into generating letter combinations of intentional misspellings. Popular ones were "K.G." for "know go", "K.Y." for "know use", and "O.W." for "oll write". "O.K." naturally followed, standing for "oll korrect". O.K. is the only one that survived through the years. It's because of Martin Van Buren, elected our eighth president in 1836. He was born in Kinderhook, New York. Early in his political career, he was nicknamed "Old Kinderhook", which echoed the Oll Korrect initialism. OK became the rallying cry of the Old Kinderhook Club, a political organization supporting Van Buren during the 1840 campaign. The initials stuck as what H. L. Mencken described as "the most shining and sucessful Americanism ever invented".

Anna Eleanor Roosevelt \\n\\nA shy, awkward child, starved for recognition and love, Eleanor Roosevelt grew into a woman with great sensitivity to the underprivileged of all creeds, races, and nations. Her constant work to improve their lot made her one of the most loved--and for some years one of the most revered--women of her generation. \\n\\nShe was born in New York City on October 11, 1884, daughter of lovely Anna Hall and Elliott Roosevelt, younger brother of Theodore. When her mother died in 1892, the children went to live with Grandmother Hall; her adored father died only two years later. Attending a distinguished school in England gave her, at 15, her first chance to develop self-confidence among other girls. \\n\\n \\nTall, slender, graceful of figure but apprehensive at the thought of being a wallflower, she returned for a debut that she dreaded. In her circle of friends was a distant cousin, handsome young Franklin Delano Roosevelt. They became engaged in 1903 and were married in 1905, with her uncle the President giving the bride away. Within eleven years Eleanor bore six children; one son died in infancy. "I suppose I was fitting pretty well into the pattern of a fairly conventional, quiet, young society matron," she wrote later in her autobiography. \\n\\nIn Albany, where Franklin served in the state Senate from 1910 to 1913, Eleanor started her long career as political helpmate. She gained a knowledge of Washington and its ways while he served as Assistant Secretary of the Navy. When he was stricken with poliomyelitis in 1921, she tended him devotedly. She became active in the women's division of the State Democratic Committee to keep his interest in politics alive. From his successful campaign for governor in 1928 to the day of his death, she dedicated her life to his purposes. She became eyes and ears for him, a trusted and tireless reporter. \\n\\nWhen Mrs. Roosevelt came to the White House in 1933, she understood social conditions better than any of her predecessors and she transformed the role of First Lady accordingly. She never shirked official entertaining; she greeted thousands with charming friendliness. She also broke precedent to hold press conferences, travel to all parts of the country, give lectures and radio broadcasts, and express her opinions candidly in a daily syndicated newspaper column, "My Day." \\n\\nThis made her a tempting target for political enemies but her integrity, her graciousness, and her sincerity of purpose endeared her personally to many--from heads of state to servicemen she visited abroad during World War II. As she had written wistfully at 14: "...no matter how plain a woman may be if truth & loyalty are stamped upon her face all will be attracted to her...." \\n\\nAfter the President's death in 1945 she returned to a cottage at his Hyde Park estate; she told reporters: "the story is over." Within a year, however, she began her service as American spokesman in the United Nations. She continued a vigorous career until her strength began to wane in 1962. She died in New York City that November, and was buried at Hyde Park beside her husband.

The Château de Versailles —or simply Versailles— is a royal château, outside the gates of which the village of Versailles, France, has grown to become a full-fledged city. From 1682, when King Louis XIV moved from Paris, until the royal family was forced to return to the capital in 1789, the court of Versailles was the center of power under the Ancien Régime. Those who are not French tend to call it the "Palace".

With the flu spreading around the world, the virus has turned up in birds in Asia and Europe, and it is feared that migrating flocks could take it to the Middle East and Africa. So far, the bird flu has only been passed from birds, either to other birds or in the isolated cases, to humans. However, if the flu mutates into a strain that can pass from human to human, people will have no immunity and the flu will probably pass rapidly from person to person, creating a pandemic. Flu vaccines can only be made to protect against a particular virus, and, since the virus has yet to be passed from human to human, no vaccine can be developed.\\n\\nIn Asia, many people live with ducks and chickens in their homes, and in their yards. Health and veterinary officials worldwide recently announced that a key way to stop the spread of the disease is to improve farming practices, segregating poultry from humans, and culling birds that have been infected with the deadly virus.\\n\\nWhat's next? When asked for predictions as to the seriousness of the pandemic, should one occur, experts have based their projections on a similar pandemic that occurred in 1918-1919. Up to a billion people fell ill, and nearly 100 million died worldwide. Translating to today's figures, they project that some 30-60 percent of the world's population could be infected by the virus, and over 300 million people worldwide could die. In the meantime, good hygiene remains the best prevention: keep hands well-washed, and avoid contact with people who have been infected with the virus.

I came here because of my deep interest and affection for a land settled by the Dutch in the mid-seventeenth century, then taken over by the British, and at last independent; a land in which the native inhabitants were at first subdued, but relations with whom remain a problem to this day; a land which defined itself on a hostile frontier; a land which has tamed rich natural resources through the energetic application of modern technology; a land which once imported slaves, and now must struggle to wipe out the last traces of that former bondage. I refer, of course, to the United States of America. \\n     But I am glad to come here to South Africa. I am already enjoying my visit. I am making an effort to meet and exchange views with people from all walks of life, and all segments of South African opinion, including those who represent the views of the government. Today I am glad to meet with the National Union of South African Students. For a decade, NUSAS has stood and worked for the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights--principles which embody the collective hopes of men of good will all around the world.\\n\\n     Your work, at home and in international student affairs, has brought great credit to yourselves and to your country. I know the National Student Association in the United States feels a particularly close relationship to NUSAS. And I wish to thank especially Mr. Ian Robertson, who first extended this invitation on behalf of NUSAS, for his kindness to me. It's too bad he can't be with us today.\\n\\n     This is a Day of Affirmation, a celebration of liberty. We stand here in the name of freedom.\\n\\n     At the heart of that Western freedom and democracy is the belief that the individual man, the child of God, is the touchstone of value, and all society, groups, the state, exist for his benefit. Therefore the enlargement of liberty for individual human beings must be the supreme goal and the abiding practice of any Western society.\\n\\n     The first element of this individual liberty is the freedom of speech: the right to express and communicate ideas, to set oneself apart from the dumb beasts of field and forest; to recall governments to their duties and obligations; above all, the right to affirm one's membership and allegiance to the body politic--to society--to the men with whom we share our land, our heritage, and our children's future.\\n\\n     Hand in hand with freedom of speech goes the power to be heard, to share in the decisions of government which shape men's lives. Everything that makes man's life worthwhile--family, work, education, a place to rear one's children and a place to rest one's head--all this depends on decisions of government; all can be swept away by a government which does not heed the demands of its people. Therefore, the essential humanity of men can be protected and preserved only where government must answer--not just to the wealthy, not just to those of a particular religion, or a particular race, but to all its people.\\n\\n     And even government by the consent of the governed, as in our own Constitution, must be limited in its power to act against its people; so that there may be no interference with the right to worship, or with the security of the home; no arbitrary imposition of pains or penalties by officials high or low; no restrictions on the freedom of men to seek education or work or opportunity of any kind, so that each man may become all he is capable of becoming.\\n\\n     These are the sacred rights of Western society. These were the essential differences between us and Nazi Germany, as they were between Athens and Persia.\\n\\n     They are the essence of our differences with communism today. I am unalterably opposed to communism because it exalts the state over the individual and the family, and because of the lack of freedom of speech, of protest, of religion, and of the press, which is the characteristic of totalitarian stat

The primary purpose of accounting is to provide information useful for making decisions.\\n\\nInternal users:\\n* Management - obtain financial information in a way that best suits its needs, (i.e. ways to cut costs, maximize profit, etc.).\\n* Board of Directors - information to assist in determination of current executive positions\\n\\nExternal users:\\n* IRS - requires the information be presented in a very specific manner.\\n* Stockholders and potentional stockholders - information that will aid in decision continue to hold the stock, sell the stock, or purchase the stock.\\n* Bondholders, bankers & other creditors - information that will aid in decision of whether or not to purchase the bond. Bank needs information that will help it determine the company's ability to repay the loan and interest.\\n* Employee (can also be considered internal) - information that will aid in decision to continue working at the company or look for employment elsewhere.\\n* Supplier - information to aid in decision to continue or start supplying to the company.
You'd have to hire a structural engineer to safely design a bridge for a car.  Also, you'd need to have an engineer assign a flow (Q) value for a given rain event based on the 200 acres.  The Q is a result of the type of landuse upstream.  Then given the dimentions of the channel you'll know how high the water elevation will be given a certain storm event, thus the high of the bridge.\\n\\nI'd contact the local municipality engineering department to find what the requirements (rain event, freeboard) are for flow and structures.  There might also be an easement on the ditch.  If that's the case, you might not be able to construct a thing.

Remember that the amount of mass and energy in the universe is constant. The mass would eventually condense into a cosmic phenomenon known as the Big Crunch (the exact opposite of the Big Bang). That is what modern physics says, anyway. If you don't believe in that stuff you don't have to.

Well, I don't understand why denying that Islam has problems and should be corrected.  it drives me nuts when ppl say that those religious terrorists groups are not real muslims. then who is real and what is real? you should first cleanse Islam openly and honestly from all hatred rules toward others. say that the rules that violate laws should be thrown away, not the opposite.  it is interesting ppl say that those are not real Muslims while they say Saudi is best or Iranian is best and both they endorse or do nothing to hate.   clerics you hear them from time to time, saying that hate to the infidels and non-muslims is duty!!! and those who say anyone cooperate with christian and jews are traitors or infidels or whatever.

This satisfies the legal requirements that a person is "a danger to self or others" and can be treated involuntarily."* Sick.\\n\\n"If you talk to God, you are praying; \\nIf God talks to you, you have schizophrenia.\\nIf the dead talk to you, you are a spiritualist; \\nIf God talks to you, you are a schizophrenic."\\n\\nThomas S.

:}\\nThe Seven Virtues were derived from the Psychomachia , an epic poem written by Aurelius Clemens Prudentius entailing the battle of good virtues and evil vices. \\n\\n1.  Pride vs. Humility         Seeing ourselves as we are and not comparing ourselves to others is humility. Pride and vanity are competitive. If someone else's pride really bothers you, you have a lot of pride.\\n2.  Envy vs. Love           "Love is patient, love is kind…" Love actively seeks the good of others for their sake. Envy resents the good others receive or even might receive. Envy is almost indistinguishable from pride at times.\\n3.   Wrath/Anger vs. Kindness          Kindness means taking the tender approach, with patience and compassion. Anger is often our first reaction to the problems of others. Impatience with the faults of others is related to this.\\n4. Sloth vs. Zeal           Zeal is the energetic response of the heart to God's commands. The other sins work together to deaden the spiritual senses so we first become slow to respond to God and then drift completely into the sleep of complacency.\\n5. Avarice/Greed vs. Generosity        This is about more than money. Generosity means letting others get the credit or praise. It is giving without having expectations of the other person. Greed wants to get its "fair share" or a bit more.\\n6.  Gluttony vs. Faith and Temperance     Temperance accepts the natural limits of pleasures and preserves this natural balance. This does not pertain only to food, but to entertainment and other legitimate goods, and even the company of others.\\n7.    Lust vs. Self control          Self  control and self mastery prevent pleasure from killing the soul by suffocation. Legitimate pleasures are controlled in the same way an athlete's muscles are: for maximum efficiency without damage. Lust is the self-destructive drive for pleasure out of proportion to its worth. Sex, power, or image can be used well, but they tend to go out of control.

I don't think it is a planet since it doesn't have much in common with the other eight planets.  However I don't feel it is an asteriod for the same reason.

Pluto has much in common with these objects but just happens to be one the the largest and closest.

At present, Mozilla Firefox wins the race.\\nVersion 1.5 introduces several new features, including an improved software update system, a new option to clear private browsing data, drag-and-drop reordering of browser tabs, and more robust pop-up blocking.\\n\\nAs more users continue to abandon Internet Explorer, Mozilla's popular Firefox gains traction in the browser space. Version 1.5 of Firefox offers a few notable features, foremost of which is the ability to reorder tabs by dragging and dropping them. You'll also find a tool that lets you quickly clean up your surfing history with two clicks of the mouse or a hot-key combo. The latest iteration of the browser seems more responsive than it has in the past and also is more efficient; with 10 windows open, Firefox consumed slightly less RAM than either IE or Opera.\\n\\nIf you're new to Firefox entirely, you'll appreciate the other features, including the RSS feeds, the JavaScript debugger, the basic download manager, and the ability to search several popular sites (such as Google) directly from the address bar. You can easily create toolbars by dragging and dropping icons. More technically minded users will appreciate that Firefox displays the page source in a new window, using indents and color-coded tags like an HTML editor. The built-in pop-up blocker is still extremely effective, and Firefox's reuptation for tight security is still well deserved. Anyone who's tired of IE will find more than one reason to like this free alternative.\\n\\nTop Ten Reason To Switch To Firefox:\\n1. Tabbed Browsing - Makes surfing the web faster\\n2. Popup Blocking\\n3. Find Stuff Easier\\n4. Simplified Privacy / Annoyance Eliminator\\n5. Better Bookmarks and History\\n6. Accessible, Intelligent, Responsive\\n7. Customizable and Extendable\\n8. Modern Download Manager\\n9. Built for standards\\n10. KISS (Keep It Simple and Straight-Forward)
Ocean currents have a tempering effect on the climate of Boston, MA. In other words, the ocean is warmer than the land in the winter, and colder than the land in the summer. This has the effect of making both the summer and the winter more mild than they are more inland, although the effect is not as strong as on the west coast of the US, because the prevailing winds blow from west to east in the US.\\n\\nAlso, because the ocean currents hitting Boston, MA are coming from the Carribbean Ocean, hurricaines occasionally make their way to MA.

Electromagnetic fields cause both ions and electrons to move about.  This can produce heat, damaging effects, or even severe injury depending on the strength and frequency of the EMFs.\\n\\nIons are very important to various physiological processes, same for electron transfer.  \\n\\nToo much heat damages cells.\\n\\nTime, distance, shielding and field intensity are important factors in limiting the damages.\\n\\nUnder certain circumstances EMF can slowly cook a person.\\n\\nThere are stories about Navy people using Target Acquisition (Fire Control) radars to cook seagulls in flight.\\n\\nNuclear radiation can affect the nuclei of atoms in addition to the effects for EMF.\\n\\nYes, EMF is a type of potentially harmful radiation.  Gamma rays and light are powerful varieties of EMF.\\n\\nEven weak or slow EMF at lower frequencies can sometimes produce headaches and disorientation.\\n\\nCows in pastures have been adversely affected from both overhead and underground power lines.\\n\\nDeath is possible.\\n\\nWe live in a sea of weak EMFs.  Strong exposures can occur from nearby antennas, especially those used for broadcasting or relaying communications via radio or microwave.\\n\\nThere are meters available for monitoring EMF intensities.\\n\\nThe ionosphere and ozone layers of the atmosphere protect us from damaging rays from space.\\n\\nTV cameras must be wrapped in aluminum foil in some bad EMF areas.\\n\\nI live in a mobile home, this affords some protection too.\\n\\nGenerally microwaves and other shorter, more powerful wavelengths are more damaging.\\n\\nSunburn is a form of EMF damage.  Similarly you can see in medical work burns from other types of EMF exposure.
Hi,\\nAVG is one of the best; available from http://www.grisoft.com. The free version is good. I bought the "buy" version for 33 dollars US for two years. Use to have Norton, but uninstalled it, like AVG much, much better. There are "definitions" downloads almost every day. They do not wait to put them in one large file, like every two weeks. You can download them when they are ready, like 2 or 3 at the time.\\nI highly recommend AVG; works great on any windows system.

Sir Walter Raleigh's famous "Lost Colony" was founded on Roanoke Island, near present-day Manteo, in 1587. When the colony's governor, John White, returned to the colony in 1590 after being gone for three years, he found the settlement deserted. The only clue to what had happened to the colonists was found carved on the trunk of a tree near the settlement, the word: "Croatan." No trace of the colonists was ever found by subsequent explorers and settlers.1\\n\\nThe Stuarts succeeded Queen Elizabeth as monarchs of Britain. Charles I was beheaded in 1649 and Oliver Cromwell ruled during the "interregnum." Charles II returned the Stuarts to the throne in 1660 and rewarded his loyal supporters.

The western boundary of Carolina was to be the "South Seas."2

I've been thinking the same thing. Because of the wacky answers I've seen on this site, I have spent the last few on-call nights directing people to get proper treatment. \\n\\nI think this section is a disaster waiting to happen.

Freedom of information isn't always a good thing. Disease doesn't recognize democracy. Your chlorine analogy is not funny, these are real people I might have to take care of down the road when their problem has gotten worse after receiving BAD info from THIS website. Fighting medical ignorance has been difficult enough with scam artists making their home on the internet targeting the desperate, and the evening news proclaiming "carbs" are bad, no wait now they are good, and telling the public everything causes cancer. Of course the public is confused. THIS forum only makes it worse.\\n\\nI've written to Yahoo Answers about this, but haven't received a reply.

This is a very interesting question. There are obviously many complicated processes going on in a living creature that can be described as physical and chemical processes, and we are slowly starting to understand them. \\n\\nHowever, is it possible to produce artificial life by just producing the correct machinery? Or is there something else involved? There is progress being made towards imitating the systems we observe in nature in the laboratory. Will they be alive in the same way? What about more advanced life forms? What is consciousness anyway? Does it come spontaneously with a certain structure or does it take something else?\\n\\nI do not think anyone really knows yet. However, there are probably strong theological arguments why the actual "life spark" or "consciousness" requires some sort of supernatural intervention. In the next few decades, we will probably get much closer to answering this question.
There are reasons, and mainly they have to do with power supply kicking off, pulling a lot of current and then your hard drive spin up. They are using air as bearings for the drive, so they float when running but when off sit metal on metal. \\n\\nIt is like starting a car, a lot of things are happening and typically that is when a car fails. \\n\\nAlso, if you mean just rebooting all the time, that is because windows creates virtual memory allocations of your hard drive for swap memory. These tend to get fragmented and take up a lot of memory if you just power off without shutting down. If you have done a lot of these, just fragment your hard drive and that will clean up the fragmentation, just not the files themselves.

Gas mileage is usually worse in the cold weather. In the cold weather your tire pressure is lower and causes more friction with the ground. \\n\\nAlso the type of gasoline you put in your car is different in the summer and winter. Summer fuel is required to have a lower RVP, to mitigate evaporative emissions caused by higher temperatures. It is literally heavier, with more chemical bonds in the fuel molecules... more bonds to break = higher energy content = better MPG.\\n\\nAnd finally your car also faces more friction driving through cold air because the colder the air is the more dense it is.

This depends mainly on which state you are . Usually the more immigrants like Texas, California , Florida could take 7 to 15 months. Other states with few cases could be shorter. If you've got the labor permit I believe you are more than halfway in the process, once you start the i485 ( not sure if the correct number) you are done , just a matter of wait. The more  important document you need in this stage is the travel document or travel parole that is only valid for one year and take slike two months to renew so you need to apply every 10 months. with thia paper you are free to move outside of the US and comeback. You do not need a visa anymore just wait until your residence card is ready.
Yes.  Because the frequency of the notes are a geometric sequence with a factor of 2^(1/12) between each note, and 2^(n/12) is irrational except for when n is divisible by 12.  There are 12 half-steps in an octave.\\n\\nThe frequency of A (just below middle C) is 220 Hz.  So the frequency of a note that is one half-step above A is 220*(2^(1/12)).

eating healthy has a fair amount of common sense to it. try and eat a balanced diet. your body needs three basic food groups, carbs, fats and proteins. diets like atkins do work but they are extremely bad for you. \\neat fruit and salad for vitamins, rice bread potatoes etc for carbs. red meat will give you proteins and fats, white meat will give you proteins and less fat. for fats you can always use olive oil. grilled meat is best for dieting. \\nto lose weight take your daily recommended calorie intake, minus about 200 cal from that and then split that amount of calories into 6 meals that you eat regularly through out the day. drink plenty of water. for lunch and dinner take about a fist sized portion of carbs,meat and salad. avoid eating carbs for about 3-4 hrs before you sleep. chew your food for a long time.\\nyour exercise programme sounds ok, you could always ask a personnal trainer to give you a structured weighs programme.\\nto be completley honest it sounds like you large hips and thighs may be to do with genetics as well. the exercises that you are doing shouldn't really build your thighs but should be toning them. aim to do about 45 mins of cardio work 4-5 times a week.\\ngood luck

Sex is all about desire. And after you want someone so much, and you love who they are in their entirety, sharing it with the one you love is the best answer. Sex is not just a game, and it is not just a physical thing, there is so much more depth to sex. Sex is 90 percent emotion, 10 percent physical driven. Once you have found the one who you love and cherish, and want to spend the rest of your life with.. you will feel more "mind blowing" physical reactions. Sex isn't about the feeling, it's about pleasing your partner, and them saying thank you, by pleasing you back. Making love, is making music with your body. Not just two people all up ons.

Patient, Kind, believeing, hopeing and so on. Learn to love and develope your heart for God and for others. Get close to God daily.
While all AMD processors now support 64 bit processing, the Sempron processors are AMD's "value" line, run at somewhat lower clock speeds, and have less L2 cache on chip, making them much less expensive to manufacture while still providing very good performance. (see link 1) The AMD Athlon 64 and 64FX processors (links 2,3) run at higher clock speeds and have more L2 cache, providing excellent performance, but costing much more to make than Sempron.  Athlon 64 X2 is AMD's dual core CPU, providing more stable operation for tasks such as video editing.

If you believe in Jesus, and have faith that he died on the cross for your sins. And ask him to come into your heart and forgive you for your sins. He will forgive you and accept you as his child. Then when you die, if you die before the Lord comes back, you will go to heaven and live with him. This is where others will be living happily and you can enjoy it with them and serve the Lord.\\n\\nThe other way would be going to Hell when you die. And this way is the opposite of choosing God. If you deny him, and don't believe in him, and never ask him to come into your heart, you will go to Hell and burn eternally.\\n\\nAnd This is the truth.

The Hazara ethnic group resides mainly in the central Afghanistan mountain region called 'Hazarajat or Hazaristan'. They make up anywhere between 19-25% of Afghanistan's population, but an accurate census has not been taken in decades so there is little information to verify at present. There are also significant populations of Hazaras in Pakistan and Iran.

Aphasia, a total or partial loss of the ability to use words, sometimes is quickly and completely cured after a stroke.  Since your case has been for a number of years, it is likely that aggressive therapy is necessary.  To date, treatment is mostly confined to speech therapy which helps to improve reading, writing, and comprehension skills.  Speech pathologists and neurologists would be best trained to help you recover. You should certainly contact a neurologist for more treatment information.  According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, patients tend to recover skills in language comprehension more completely than those skills involving expression.\\n\\nOn a more global level, there are a number of people who believe neural connections can be re-forged through increased usage.  A number of studies have shown that those who think more or are involved in more intelletually challenging tasks are less at risk for Alzheimer's disease, for example.  This may very well be true for stroke patients.  Keep working hard and seek as much help as you can.  Best of luck.

Her's the LONG ANSWER. Don't read on if you have a limited attention span...\\n\\nMost Liberals don't hate America. Some do no doubt. What I think is that when some consevative talking head comes on the tube and says Liberals are baaaaad!!!!, many people swallow it. There are many impressionable people in this country who are DAMN mad and want to quench the bloodlust generated by the 9/11 attack. Capitalizing on this wave of patriotic zeal the hard core neo-cons (which are not the same as average Republicans) manipulated the entire post attack national conversation. They saw this national tragedy as a way to implement a broad and radical shift in U.S. foreign policy. The Neo-Cons were able to do this because nobody, Republican or Democrat had the balls to stand up to this radiacalism in the shadow of 9/11. The small govornment, fiscaly responsible Republicans have watched in disbelief as our budgetary spending has gone where no tax and spend Liberal ever dared take it. Inflating the budget wouldn't be so bad if it went to sensible programs for security and to update ifrastructure.But instead it is being used as thank you money in the form of "pork barrel " spending around the country, into the districts of those congressman and senators who vote in favor of the Neo-Con agenda.\\n The term Liberal is batted around so much it's funny. What the traditional notion is referring to is a tax and spend agenda. Giving poor and underprivelaged people breaks and assistance in a multitude of areas, thus taking money from the people who earn money. These Liberals are actually really angry with the current administration for the way it uses tax breaks for the wealthy. Then using the budgetary process gives more money to the wealthy via the industrial war production inflated by the war on terror. Then it gives  no-bid contracts to companies such as KBR (Haliburten) and others connected to the Neo-Con teat.\\nWhat you have is a giant spending machine where the profits keep returning to the same people. This notion has yet to sink in with most republicans. They are still too enraged by 9/11 to open their eyes to what is happening. They are being manipulated to cast out the Liberals with all of their uppity talk of Constitutional law and limited Executive power. Those aren't sexy ideas to think about and for this reason most of the ranting conservatives simply roll their eyes and shake their heads,and proclaim "We should pitty those poor deluded Liberals".\\nWell one day (or not) the rest of the country will wake up and join the Liberals. The old fasion Reagan Conservatives will wake up the quickest. They'll wonder why G.W. hasn't seen fit to put an end to the orgy of spending. Why would we mortgage our future so a handful of companys can prosper in the near-term? That doesn't seem like conservativism. The very reason for anti-Liberal angst (out of controll spending) is the lifeblood of the current administration. Only this time the poor don't see the benefits. It is the mega-corporations getting our tax dollars without the oversight of the Congressional Budget Oversight Commitee.\\nIt all boils down to this: Aside from their left wing social views, Liberals are actually doing the work of the minority in any democracy. They are trying to balance the impulse of the current leadership to gorge on as much money and power as they can before their time is up.\\nThe rhetoric is so amusing. Those stupid Liberals. When will they ever learn? It seems our job as citizens isn't to think for ouselves but is to regurgitate the meaningless and empty words of our righteous benefactors the Neo-Conservative puppet masters. All of you Liberals and Conservatives should be thinking for youselves. It is a pity there are so many uneducated people in this country who speak so loudly. They try to convince the masses that it is better not to be "smart". "You don't want to be like those elitist

It cames from Maccabees (in hebrew the group of these rebels its called maccabiim it ends with im because is the plural name, if you talk about a single male rebel of this group is called maccabi) who were were Jewish rebels who fought against the rule of Antiochus IV Epiphanes of the Hellenistic Seleucid dynasty, who was succeeded by his infant son Antiochus V Eupator. The Maccabees founded the Hasmonean royal dynasty and established Jewish independence in the Land of Israel for about one hundred years, from 165 BCE to 63 BCE.\\n\\nIn 167 BCE, a Jewish priest, Mattathias, started the revolt against the Seleucid overlords of Judea by refusing to worship the Greek gods and slaying the hellenistic Jew who stepped up to worship the idol in place of Mattathias. He and his five sons fled to the wilderness. After Mattathias' death about one year later, his son Judas Maccabaeus led an army of Jewish dissidents to victory over the Seleucids. After the victory, he entered Jerusalem in triumph and religiously cleansed the Temple, reestablishing traditional Jewish worship there. Every year Jews celebrate Hanukkah in commemoration of Judas Maccabeus' victory over the Seleucids.\\n\\nThe story of the Maccabees can be found in the deuterocanonical books of 1 Maccabees and 2 Maccabees. Books of 3 Maccabees and 4 Maccabees also exist, though they are not directly related to the Maccabees.\\n\\nThe name "Maccabee" is sometimes seen used as synonym for the entire Hasmonean dynasty, but the Maccabees proper were Judas Maccabeus and his four brothers. The name Maccabee was a personal epithet of Judas, and the later generations were not descendants of him

The general ledger, sometimes known as the nominal ledger, is the main accounting record of a business which uses double-entry bookkeeping. It will usually include accounts for such items as fixed assets, current assets and liabilities, profit and loss or income and expenditure items, and funds or reserves.\\n\\nThe general ledger is a summary of all of the transactions that occur in the company. It is taken directly from the general journal, where each transaction is recorded.\\n\\nThe balance sheet and the profit/loss statement are both derived from the general ledger. Because it is organized by accounts, the general ledger allows you to observe the impact of all the transactions affecting each account at any given time. The general ledger is where posting occurs, which is the process of recording credits and debits in the general ledger. The actual balances are called the trial balance.\\n\\nThe general ledger should include the date, description and balance entries for each account. It is usually divided into at least five main categories. These categories generally include assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and sometimes additionally equity (liabilities held by the owners of the company). The main categories of the general ledger may be subdivided into subledgers to include details such as cash, accounts payable, accounts receivable, etc.\\n\\nBecause each transaction debits one account and credits another to an equal extent an accounting system will ensure that the general ledger will always be in balance unless, for example, an account (some times called a T-account) is deleted or mis-specified in the general journal.

Firstly, the milky way is in a galatic cluster, and that is in a super cluster.  (There's a lot of gravity out there.)  But those structures are too far away to detect sideway movement, only towards or away.  Also, their motion is highly relativistic.  So Galaxy is a natural place to stop.\\n\\nThe first figure will probably be within the margin of error for the second and third.  So, as I check wikipedia, I see that the sun is orbitting the galaxy at a rate of 217 kilometer per second and the earth is rotating around the sun at 29.783 km/s.  So, this person has traveled somewhere in excess (depending on how many seconds more than 46 years old they are) of 358,242,443,236.8 kilometers, or 222,468,557,250.0528 miles.  \\n\\nAlso, just as a comment, there is no "point" of the big bang.

FInd out exactly what ihe's into and give it to him, no matter how dumb or "uncool you think it is" His present should be about him.

If I buy him something expensive or really nice he's dissapointed. So find out what your guy is into (maybe a sports team, hobby, character, etc) and go with that. If it's what he's intrested in, you can't go wrong no matter what you think of it.

Law school is only a glorified trade school. Ultimately you should pursue something that you truly enjoy. Do not be persuaded by the supposed mystique associated with being a lawyer, it is based out of ignorance. Also, do not believe law school placement office statistics, they are greatly over exaggerated. As much as half a law school class from an average law school will not be lawyers. Think about that before you spend the money, time and effort. I am a lawyer with an LL.M. and a good but not great job and I feel very fortunate. I could have easily done as well if not better getting an MBA.

Some of these answers are clear evidence, that God also created brainwashing...\\n\\nDinosaurs have been extinct for appx.65-70 million years, after an asteroid landed in the Gulf of Mexico near Belize, and put the earth into darkness for 4-6 years. Geologists excavating strata all over the world have proved this.

The reason Genesis is so vague, is because it is intended to be poetic, not scientific, and because humans were not around 20 Billion years ago when the universe (Heavens)came into existence, nor were we around 4.6 Billion years ago, when our Solar System (earth) was created...

You will never be able to pick a best answer.  Love is the forever unknown.  The first time you think you're in love, you're not.  You just have a very strong emotional connection to that person.  When you are actually in love it will hit you one day that you are, it will surprise you.  And once you lose it, it's going to scar you, so bad that some people don't know how to cope and actually shutdown.  But you can live again and love again.  But you will never love in the same way.  Love is universal.  Even animals have it.  I've seen where monogamous mates will die, and the other will die shortly there after, why?  I say love.  Always remember love isn't all we need, but we definitely need it.

The first real wave of Chinese immigrants came to California beginning in 1848 in response to the discovery of gold. They were merchants who sold their stock to the settlers and miners and then went in search for gold themselves. They wrote home to share their experiences and by 1851 there were almost 25,000 Chinese, called "Celestials" for the Celestial Empire of China, on the West Coast. These immigrants were almost all from the province of Kwangtung in southern China, traveling through the harbors of Canton and Hong Kong. In rural China of the time, the purpose of life was the well-being of the family group. Many families sold possessions and/or borrowed in order to send one young man to America to make a fortune, not for himself, but to send back home to his family. The idea was to get as rich as possible as quickly as possible and then to return home. Other miners resented their lack of interest in becoming naturalized and by 1852 they were being driven from the mines. Still seeking their fortunes, many turned to jobs which the miners did not want to perform for themselves, such as cooking and laundry. By 1860 many had returned home. Then in 1862 the Union Pacific and Central Pacific cross-continental rail line began construction. A new wave of immigrants came from China through the Chinese Six Companies, organized into crews with their passage prepaid and then deducted from their monthly wages. When the railroad was completed in 1869, some Chinese returned home but for each one who returned, two more arrived. Some 123,000 came in the 1870's. The economy and political situation was against them. The Gold Rush was over and most people had failed to make their fortune. The railroad was completed, the major swamplands had been filled, and industry did not need the thousands of unskilled laborers. An agitator named Dennis Kearney organized what became the Workingman's Party in an effort to drive the immigrants away and protect American jobs. Harrassment escalated until the Exclusion Act of 1882 which was intended to prohibit the entry of Chinese laborers for ten years. Many Chinese left. Those who remained responded by moving away from the West Coast and establishing neighborhoods of their own whereever they went. Family life was the exception in these communities since most immigrants were single young men, or if married, had left their wives at home, expecting only a short stay in America. The Exclusion Laws made it almost impossible to bring family into the country. The Chinese distrusted American institutions and formed their own family associations, district organizations, and halls. Tongs were first founded as social clubs, but some, especially in San Francisco between 1880 and 1900 became involved in crime and vice. The Exclusion Laws were not repealed until the United States and China allied during World War I. Many of the original immigrants had either returned home or died, but enough remained to cause another wave of immigration as families were finally allowed to reunite. Then in 1949 the Communist takeover of mainland China caused a new wave of immigration. Unlike previous waves, many were from the educated and upper levels of society, and they brought entire families at once. This trend of educated, skilled immigrants and immigrants of all ages has continued into today.

When I first started college, I saw an advicer. I wanted to make sure I was taking the right classes for my degree. Then, after that, for two years I did. It was a waste of my time, and I knew what classes I needed. I did go see an advicer last week though just to do an evaluation, to see what classes I have left. But for the most part, in my opinion, its a waste of time.
what is "hrm"?  is it code for something or do you not know how to spell?
I do. I'm not religious, and the thing I belive in is each individual. You are your only owner and therefor you sexand your sex desires belong only to yourself, so if you want to practice sex and are old enough, mature enough and you've taken all the precautions you can have sex whenever you want to. Some people think sex belongs to marriage, some others believe that one should only have sex with someone they love (that's my case) and some others think it is ok to have sex with whoever you want to if both of the partners agree on it. From my opinion, all the choices are as respectable. Nobody is morally superior for waiting to have sex until marriage, that is just a personal decission that has to be respected.

great question, ty. The history is clear. Neocons have long wanted the USA out of the UN. They do not support peaceful contact with other Nations. The Neocons always point to the fact that we pay the most. The truth is they do not want to share any power with anyone. They also have no interest in what the other countries think or say. Neocons like Bu$h think "my way or the highway". A UN peacekeeping force could be in Iraq now (no ours) but for giving up the power and the control of oil, the wealth and the Contracts.\\nThe Saudis are not stupid. When they felt Saddam was going to invade and control the oil, they got US tax payers to pay for the defense of the oil. Saddam was a Arab problem, Arabs got the US tax payers to solve the problem.  \\nWe also deal with the loss of life and money for our own people. The Saudis should pay the $6 billion per month in Iraq not USA tax payers.

Reptiles do not use body fat to generate heat, but they _do_ store energy as fat and use it when food supply is low, or, in the case of females, to provide nutritive substances for their eggs during the breeding season. Geckoes, for instance, accumulate fat on the basal portion of their tails. Thus the "fat" tail of a gecko indicates a well-fed individual.

We all have a good idea what those virtues are, but there is not a fact among them.\\nDoes a parent love their child?  You can't do experiments on that to decide, black or white, its true or false.  As the Savage Garden song goes, "I believe parents did the best they knew how to do".\\nDo you know if an elevator is safe, for a fact, before you go into it.  No, if you had to prove everything before you believed it - assumed it - you would be frozen with uncertainty.\\nThe best you can hope for is reasonable certainty.\\nReligion is reasonable, though many religious people are totally unreasonable in they way they talk about religion.\\n\\nI guess you think science is all about facts, but most of it is theory, reasonable assumptions.

Before you do surgery, try a chiropractor or massage therapist.  The chiropractor may find that your spine is out of alignment, which is putting strain on the hip.  Or a massage therapist may discover that the muscles are in spasm, or have trigger points, which they can help you with.  I have a bad hip from when I was pregnant, and both have helped me.  Also, both a chiropractor and a massge therapist can give you stretches to help prevent it from happening again, or at least not as much.\\n\\nBlessed be\\n\\ngypsy

I can take a reasonable guess not having looked at how it's implemented...\\n\\nOnce the object exists there will be almost no difference. Remember, a class is simply a collection of functions that have protected access to a group of variables. The only real drawback in OO languages is setting up this access for new objects, but these days it's hardly worth the mention. Inheritance, and the heirarchy lookup may, but it's extremely unlikely, make some slight difference.\\n\\nAt the end of the day, you need to store in variables what you need to store. Putting them in objects is simply more convenient in so many ways. You pay a tiny bit in performance for that, but you probably use less developer resources (if they count here).

During the American Revolution, John Paul Jones was an officer aboard the USS Alfred in 1776.  The USS Alfred was part of 6-vessel fleet that attacked English merchant vessels in New Providence.  Jones raised the first American flag over a U.S. Naval vessel aboard the Alfred.\\n\\nHis first command was the frigate USS Providence. Over a period of six weeks, his ship captured 16 enemy vessels along the coast of Nova Scotia.\\n\\nIn November of 1776, he proposed a mission plan to destroy the British coal fleet and free American prisoners held at Isle Royal.  He was assigned command of the USS Alfred and successfully completed this mission, including the capture of a British ship carrying winter clothing for British troops in Canada.  This is believed to have contributed to the success of the Continental Army at Trenton by providing them with fresh winter clothes.\\n\\nIn June of 1777, he was given command of the USS Ranger and was sent to France to help Benjamin Franklin and the American contingent there with strategic recommendations.  After France signed a treaty with America in 1778, the USS Ranger sailed for England and captured the British naval ship, HMS Drake.\\n\\nIn 1779, he assumed command of the USS Bonhomme Richard.  A five ship squadron, including the Bonhomme Richard, attacked a British merchant convoy off the coast of Yorkshire.  A pair of British vessels attacked the American squadron.  Two of the vessels fled while the Bonhomme Richard and two other naval ships attacked the British warships.  The HMS Serapis severely damaged the Bonhomme Richard, shooting off her flag during the attack.  The British commander, asked if Jones had struck his colors in surrender.  In response, Jones issued his famous quotation, "I have not yet begun to fight."  He then rammed his sinking ship into the Serapis, tied up to it, boarded and captured the ship.

If you disconnect all the telephone wires from where your regular phone wire from the phone company comes into your house/apt or whatever, and then connect a regular phone (RJ11) phone cord from any one of the jacks in the house to the cable modem, and then use a doubler (a thingy you can buy from any best buy circuit city radio shack etc) you can plug the cord from any of your phones into any of the jacks, and all the jacks will be connected to the modem.  DO NOT DO THIS UNTIL YOU HAVE DISCONNECTED THE "INSIDE WIRING" FROM THE WIRE COMING FROM THE PHONE COMPANY . . otherwise the "ring voltage, which is about 90 volts, will FRY your modem . . a very bad deal.

By providing a full feed you are giving your users what they want, and they will be more inclined to look upon you favorably.  So rather than directly forcing eyeballs to your site, you are working on the reputation of your site for quality data, and hoping the users will pass along your site to others through bloglines or deli.cio.us, and getting new  eyeballs indirectly.

Two strategies:  1) cut your spending, and 2) reorganize your debt.\\n\\n1) Try to figure out the LEAST amount you can spend, and still live.  Eliminate all fees (ATM, long distance, late fees, etc).  Cancel any frills until you are debt free (got a land line AND a cell phone?  Cancel one.  Cancel cable - you'll be amazed at the deals they will offer you to come back!)  Eat in.  Don't spend a penny on Soda/candy from a machine or coffee from a trendy coffee-bar.\\n\\n2)  list your debt in order, highest interest rate to lowest.  Your strategy is to eliminate the highest ones, either by moving the debt down to lower rates, or by paying it off.  \\n\\nI disagree with the previous answer (not to pay off credit card debt with an equity line).  Of course, this should be done with care, but this is one of the best strategies - secured debt (like an equity line) is almost always cheaper interest rate than unsecured debt (like credit cards).  "You could lose your house", yes, if you are stupid or not careful.  But you can also eliminate debt much quicker!  \\n\\nShop every rate that you have.  If you have an Equity line at Prime + 2, Shop it.  You may be able to get a Home Equity line at Prime - .75 (I just did).\\n\\nI believe that it's to my advantage to have debt and savings.  Low interest, tax-saving debt can be a good thing (like my Home Equity Line).  High interest debt and fees are for somebody besides me.

Since China is a communist country and doesn't practice democracy, freedoms are very limited. The government doesn't want the Chinese people to have unlimited information to the rest of the world. If they do, then the people will realize how little freedom they have compared to the US. Also by banning sites, China is banning opportunities for demonstrations/uprisings, which could lead to violence. That could lead to international attention and would cause China to lose face.
